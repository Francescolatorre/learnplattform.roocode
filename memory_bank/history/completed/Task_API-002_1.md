# TASK-API-002: API Layer Setup

## Title
API Layer Setup

## Status
DONE

## Last Update
2025-03-02

## Description
Set up the API layer for the learning management system. This includes defining routes, controllers, and creating TypeScript interfaces for API interactions. Ensure TypeScript interfaces in `frontend/src/types` are updated to align with the current API structure as documented in the backend API specifications.

## Requirements
- Define API routes and controllers.
- Update TypeScript interfaces to ensure they match the data structures used in the API, specifically focusing on the `Course` and related entities.

## Validation Criteria
- API routes and controllers are correctly defined and functional.
- TypeScript interfaces accurately reflect the data structures used in the API and are properly typed.

## Dependencies
Completion of the frontend setup (TASK-FRONTEND-001)

## Expected Outcome
A fully functional API layer that interacts seamlessly with the frontend and other parts of the system. TypeScript interfaces have been updated to ensure type safety and alignment with backend data structures.

## Assigned To
Code Mode

## Notes
- Ensure that the API layer is secure and follows best practices for API development.
- Review the existing TypeScript interfaces and update them as necessary to ensure they are comprehensive and align with the backend API's current structure.
- **Important Rule**: During this phase of frontend development, no changes should be made to the backend. All modifications should be confined to the frontend to ensure stability and integrity of the backend services.
