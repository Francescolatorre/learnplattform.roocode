## 4. Cost Optimization Strategy

### **Batch API Pricing Advantages**

**OpenAI Model Cost Comparison (with Batch 50% discount):**

- **GPT-4o Mini**: $0.075/$0.30 per 1M tokens → **$0.038/$0.15 batch** (Ultra-low cost for testing)
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: $0.50/$1.50 per 1M tokens → **$0.25/$0.75 batch** (Good balance)
- **GPT-4o**: $2.50/$10.00 per 1M tokens → **$1.25/$5.00 batch** (High quality)
- **GPT-4**: $30.00/$60.00 per 1M tokens → **$15.00/$30.00 batch** (Premium)

**Cost-Optimized MVP Strategy:**
- **Testing Phase**: Start with GPT-4o Mini (≈$0.10 per assessment)
- **Production**: GPT-3.5 Turbo for most assessments (≈$0.50 per assessment)
- **Premium**: GPT-4o for complex/important assessments (≈$2.00 per assessment)

**Annual Cost Projection (50,000 assessments with model mix):**
- **Testing-Heavy MVP**: $6,000/year (mostly GPT-4o Mini)
- **Production Mix**: $25,000/year (80% GPT-3.5, 20% GPT-4o)
- **Savings vs Manual**: $40,000+ instructor time saved

### **Intelligent Cost Management**

**Dynamic Provider Selection:**

```python
class CostOptimizer:
    def select_provider(self, token_count: int, urgency: str) -> str:
        # Real-time cost comparison across providers
        # Factor in current pricing, queue lengths, performance history

    def optimize_batch_composition(self, queued_items: List) -> List[BatchJob]:
        # Group assessments for maximum provider discounts
        # Balance batch sizes with processing time requirements
```

**Budget Controls:**

- Real-time spend monitoring with automatic alerts at 75%, 90%, 95%
- Automatic batch size reduction when approaching budget limits
- Emergency manual override for critical assessments
- Monthly budget rollover and allocation adjustments

## 5. User Experience Design

### **Student Experience Flow**

**Submission Process:**

1. **Submit Task** → Immediate confirmation with processing timeline
2. **Queue Status** → "Your assessment is #47 in queue, estimated completion: 3 hours"
3. **Progress Updates** → "Assessment moved to batch processing (estimated 45 minutes)"
4. **Completion Notification** → Email/platform notification with detailed feedback
5. **Review Access** → Full assessment results with improvement suggestions

**Status Communication:**

```typescript
interface IAssessmentStatus {
  status: 'queued' | 'batched' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed'
  queuePosition?: number
  estimatedCompletion: Date
  batchId?: string
  progressMessage: string
  canEscalate: boolean  // If real-time processing is available
}
```

### **Instructor Experience**

**Prompt Management Interface:**

- Rich text editor with LLM-specific formatting helpers
- Variable insertion dropdowns (`{student_submission}`, `{task_criteria}`, etc.)
- Live preview with sample submissions
- Template library for common assessment types
- A/B testing framework for prompt optimization

**Batch Monitoring Dashboard:**

- Real-time queue status across all courses
- Cost tracking with budget alerts
- Batch performance analytics
- Failed assessment management
- Bulk assessment review interface

### **Communication Strategy**

**Setting Expectations:**

- Clear onboarding explaining batch vs real-time processing
- Timeline estimates based on current queue length
- Progress notifications at key milestones
- Educational content during waiting periods

**Notification Templates:**

```
Assessment Queued: "Your submission has been received and queued for AI assessment. Expected feedback: [TIME_ESTIMATE]. Track progress: [LINK]"

Processing Started: "Your assessment is being processed in batch [BATCH_ID]. Results typically available within 30-60 minutes."

Assessment Complete: "Your AI assessment is ready! Score: [SCORE]. View detailed feedback: [LINK]"

Processing Delayed: "We're experiencing higher than usual volume. Your assessment will be completed within [EXTENDED_TIME]. Priority processing available: [LINK]"
```
