# Archived Tasks

This directory contains task files that have been archived as part of the task consolidation process. These tasks fall into one of the following categories:

1. **Completed Tasks**: Tasks that have been successfully completed and no longer require active tracking.
2. **Obsolete Tasks**: Tasks that have been superseded by newer tasks or are no longer relevant to the project.
3. **Duplicate Tasks**: Tasks that have overlapping functionality with other tasks and have been consolidated.

## Handling Archived Tasks

When working with archived tasks, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Reference Only**: Archived tasks should be used for reference purposes only. Do not reactivate or modify these tasks without proper review.
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Extract valuable information from archived tasks when creating new related tasks.
3. **Historical Context**: Use archived tasks to understand the historical context and evolution of the project.

## Archiving Process

Tasks are archived using the following process:

1. Task is identified as completed, obsolete, or duplicate in the task consolidation overview.
2. Task file is moved from `memory_bank/tasks/` to `memory_bank/archive/tasks/`.
3. Task status is updated in all tracking files (progress.md, project_status.md, activeContext.md).
4. References to the task are updated in related documentation.

1. Review the task consolidation overview to understand why it was archived.
2. Discuss the reactivation with the project team.
3. Update all tracking files to reflect the reactivation.
4. Move the task file back to the `memory_bank/tasks/` directory.

## Maintenance

This archive is maintained as part of the regular project governance process. Periodic reviews ensure that the archive remains organized and valuable as a reference resource.
