## Task Metadata

* **Task-ID:** TASK-045
* **Status:** COMPLETED

## Business Context

**Bug Discovery**: During testing of TASK-042 (Task Deletion Feature), a critical navigation bug was discovered in the student task view workflow.

**User Impact**: Students cannot access individual task details when clicking "View Task" from their course task list, preventing them from completing assignments and viewing task content.

**Business Priority**: This breaks a core user journey for students and must be resolved immediately to maintain platform usability.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Behavior (Broken)
1. Student enrolls in course (e.g. course 727)
2. Student navigates to course task list
3. Student clicks "View Task" on any task
4. **BUG**: Student is redirected to their profile page instead of task details

### Expected Behavior
1. Student enrolls in course 
2. Student navigates to course task list
3. Student clicks "View Task" on any task
4. **EXPECTED**: Student sees task details page with task content, instructions, and submission interface

### Root Cause Analysis Needed
- Navigation routing issue in student task view
- Possible authentication/role-based routing misconfiguration
- URL parameter handling in task detail navigation

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Navigation Fix**: "View Task" button must route students to correct task detail page
2. **Task Content Display**: Students must see full task details (title, description, instructions)
3. **Role-based Content**: Students see appropriate interface (no instructor controls)
4. **URL Integrity**: Task URLs must be properly formatted and accessible
5. **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Students can navigate back to course task list

### Technical Requirements
1. **Route Validation**: Verify student task detail routes are properly configured
2. **Component Mapping**: Ensure student task view component is correctly mapped
3. **Authentication Check**: Verify role-based access control for student task views
4. **Parameter Passing**: Ensure task ID and course ID parameters are correctly passed
5. **Error Handling**: Proper fallback if task is not found or access denied

### User Experience Requirements
1. **Immediate Fix**: Students can access all enrolled course tasks
2. **Consistent Navigation**: Task view navigation works from all entry points
3. **Performance**: Task details load within 2 seconds
4. **Mobile Compatibility**: Navigation works on mobile devices
5. **Accessibility**: Task details are accessible to screen readers

## Technical Analysis

### Investigation Areas
1. **Frontend Routing**: 
   - Check react-router configuration for student task detail routes
   - Verify route parameters and path matching
   - Review navigation component implementations

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Validate role-based routing logic
   - Check if student role is properly recognized in navigation
   - Verify token-based access control

3. **Component Architecture**:
   - Identify correct student task view component
   - Check if instructor vs student task views are properly separated
   - Verify component props and state management

### Likely File Locations
- `frontend/src/routes/` - Route configuration
- `frontend/src/pages/learningTasks/` - Task view components  
- `frontend/src/components/tasks/` - Task-related components
- `frontend/src/context/auth/` - Authentication routing logic

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation (1-2 hours)
1. Reproduce the bug in development environment
2. Trace the navigation flow from task list to task detail
3. Identify the exact point where routing fails
4. Document the current route configuration

### Phase 2: Fix Implementation (2-3 hours)
1. Fix route configuration for student task detail pages
2. Update navigation components to use correct routes
3. Ensure role-based routing works properly
4. Test navigation from multiple entry points

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (1 hour)
1. Verify fix works for multiple courses and tasks
2. Test with different student accounts
3. Validate mobile and desktop navigation
4. Ensure no regression in instructor task views

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Login as student
- [ ] Enroll in multiple courses (727, 748, etc.)
- [ ] Navigate to course task lists
- [ ] Click "View Task" on various tasks
- [ ] Verify correct task detail page loads
- [ ] Test navigation back to course list
- [ ] Verify no instructor controls are visible

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Update E2E tests to include student task navigation
- [ ] Add unit tests for routing configuration
- [ ] Test role-based component rendering

### Regression Testing
- [ ] Verify instructor task views still work
- [ ] Check task creation and editing flows
- [ ] Validate course enrollment navigation

---

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies
- May require coordination with TASK-042 testing to avoid conflicts
- Authentication system must be functioning

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **User Experience Impact**: Students cannot complete assignments
- **Platform Usability**: Core functionality is broken
- **User Retention**: Students may abandon platform if tasks are inaccessible

### Medium Risk
- **Testing Complexity**: Need to test across multiple user roles
- **Routing Complexity**: Changes might affect other navigation flows

### Mitigation
- **Immediate Investigation**: Prioritize root cause analysis
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each fix before deploying
- **Rollback Plan**: Maintain ability to revert changes quickly

## Notes

### Bug Discovery Context
- Discovered during comprehensive testing of TASK-042 (Task Deletion Feature)
- Affects course 727 and likely all courses with enrolled students
- Critical blocker for student user journey
- No workaround available for affected students

### Investigation Notes
- Bug appears to be in frontend routing configuration
- Likely affects all students across all courses
- May be related to recent navigation changes  
- Profile page redirection suggests authentication/routing conflict

### Root Cause Analysis (COMPLETED)
**Issue**: Component import/export name mismatch
- `AppRoutes.tsx` imports `LearningTaskViewPage` 
- `LearningTaskViewPage.tsx` exported `TaskViewPage` as default
- When React Router tries to render the component, it fails due to undefined component
- Fallback route `path="*"` redirects to `/profile` (AppRoutes.tsx:207)

### Solution Implemented
**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/pages/learningTasks/LearningTaskViewPage.tsx:9` - Changed `TaskViewPage` â†’ `LearningTaskViewPage`
- `frontend/src/pages/learningTasks/LearningTaskViewPage.tsx:101` - Updated export to match

**Result**: Students can now navigate to `/tasks/:taskId` and see task details instead of being redirected to profile page.
