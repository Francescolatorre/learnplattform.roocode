## Overview
This document defines the standards and practices for maintaining consistency across all Roo rule definitions and implementations.

## Scope

## Guidelines

### 1. Document Structure
All rule documents must follow this consistent structure:
- Version information
- Last updated date
- Clear overview and scope sections
- Detailed content with hierarchical headers
- Related document references
- Enforcement or implementation details

### 2. Version Numbering
- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Coordinate version updates with [versioning strategy](versioning.md)
- Document all changes in version history

### 3. Cross-Reference Management
- Use relative paths for all document links
- Maintain bidirectional references between related documents
- Update all affected documents when making changes

### 4. Role-Specific Rules
- Must align with [core governance principles](governance.md)
- Should not conflict with other role definitions
- Must clearly define boundaries and interactions

### 5. Process Definitions
- Use consistent terminology across all documents
- Maintain clear workflow definitions
- Include validation and verification steps
