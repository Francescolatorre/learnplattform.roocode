# ADR-019: Task Documentation Standards

## Metadata
Version: 1.0.0
Status: Proposed
Last Updated: 2025-06-23

## Context

### Problem Statement
The learning platform requires a standardized approach to task documentation to ensure consistency, traceability, and effective collaboration across all roles and project phases.

### Current Situation
- Task documentation varies in structure and completeness
- Status tracking is inconsistent between activeContext.md and progress.md
- Cross-referencing and dependency tracking needs standardization
- Validation criteria are not consistently documented

### Impact Scope
- All project tasks and subtasks
- Task tracking and management processes
- Cross-team collaboration
- Project governance
- Quality assurance

### Stakeholders
- Digital Design team
- Architecture team
- Development team
- QA team
- Project managers

## Decision

We will adopt a comprehensive task documentation standard that includes:

### 1. Task Template Structure

```markdown
# TASK-[ID]: [Descriptive Title]

## Metadata
Version: X.Y.Z
Status: [DRAFT|VALIDATED|TODO|IN_PROGRESS|REVIEW|DONE|BLOCKED]
Priority: [HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW]
Role: [Digital Design|Architect|Code|Debug]
Created: YYYY-MM-DD
Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
Owner: [Username]

## Overview
[Brief description of the task's purpose and goals]

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Clearly defined deliverables
- Expected behavior
- User acceptance criteria

### Technical Requirements
- Implementation constraints
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations
- Compatibility requirements

### Dependencies
- Related tasks: [TASK-IDs]
- Required resources
- External dependencies
- Prerequisite conditions

## Implementation
### Approach
- Proposed implementation strategy
- Technical design considerations
- Risk mitigation steps

### Subtasks
1. [Subtask-1]
   - Status: [DRAFT|IN_PROGRESS|DONE]
   - Description
   - Acceptance criteria
2. [Subtask-2]
   ...

## Validation Criteria
### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage
- Integration test scenarios
- Performance test criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
- Functional validation points
- Quality requirements
- Documentation requirements
- Review checklist

## Progress Tracking
### Status Updates
- Current status
- Blockers/Issues
- Next steps

### Metrics
- Progress percentage
- Time tracking
- Quality metrics

```

### 2. Version Control Guidelines

- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Major: Breaking changes to task structure or requirements
- Minor: Backwards-compatible additions
- Patch: Documentation updates and clarifications

### 3. Status Tracking Integration

- Maintain real-time status in activeContext.md
- Record completion in progress.md
- Include status change history
- Document blocking issues

### 4. Cross-Reference Management

- Use relative paths for all document links
- Reference related tasks and subtasks
- Link to relevant ADRs and documentation
- Maintain bidirectional references

## Consequences

### Benefits
- Consistent task documentation across projects
- Clear traceability and dependency tracking
- Improved collaboration between roles
- Standardized progress tracking
- Better quality assurance

### Drawbacks
- Initial overhead in documentation
- Learning curve for new template
- Migration effort for existing tasks

### Technical Impacts
- Updates to task tracking tools
- Changes to review processes
- Documentation tooling requirements

### Required Changes
- Update task creation workflows
- Modify existing task documentation
- Update related processes
- Train team on new standards

## Implementation

### Required Steps
1. Create template in version control
2. Update task creation tools/scripts
3. Document migration guidelines
4. Train teams on new standard
5. Review and update existing tasks

### Dependencies
- Task management tools
- Documentation systems
- Version control system
- Team training resources

### Migration Plan
1. Apply to new tasks immediately
2. Identify critical existing tasks for update
3. Gradually migrate remaining tasks
4. Validate documentation compliance

### Validation Criteria
- All new tasks follow template
- Consistent cross-referencing
- Complete metadata and tracking
- Proper version control
- Accurate status tracking
