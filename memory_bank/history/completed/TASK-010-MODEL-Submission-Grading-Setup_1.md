# TASK-010-MODEL: Submission Grading Setup

## Task Metadata

- **Task-ID:** TASK-010-MODEL: Submission Grading Setup
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** High
- **Dependencies:** [TASK-VISIBILITY-001](./TASK-032.md)
- **Last Updated:** 2025-06-23

## Description

Enable students to submit work for tasks and create a robust submission tracking system.

## Business Context

The submission system is critical for:

- Facilitating student work submission and assessment
- Enabling instructors to track and grade assignments
- Ensuring academic integrity through submission validation
- Supporting the learning feedback loop

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Submission System
   - Support text-based submissions
   - Allow file uploads
   - Link submissions to specific tasks
   - Validate submission against task requirements
   - Implement submission deadline tracking

2. Submission Tracking
   - Record submission timestamp
   - Track submission status (Pending, Submitted, Late)
   - Provide student submission history
   - Support multiple submission attempts if allowed

### Technical Requirements

- Frontend: Create submission interface
- Backend: Implement submission validation and storage
- Database: Design submission tracking model
- Storage: Integrate file upload mechanism

## Validation Criteria

- [x] Students can submit only Published tasks
- [x] Submissions are correctly linked to tasks
- [x] Submission history is preserved
- [x] File and text submission types work
- [x] Submission deadlines are enforced

## Implementation

- Use Django FileField for file uploads
- Create comprehensive submission validation
- Implement submission status state machine
- Support multiple file types
- Ensure secure file storage
- Handle file size limitations

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Students can submit task work
2. Submissions are tracked accurately
3. Instructors can view submissions
4. Submission rules are consistently applied
5. Files are stored securely
6. Submission history is maintained

## Estimated Effort

- Frontend: 5 story points
- Backend: 6 story points
- Total: 11 story points

## Potential Risks

- Handling large file uploads
- Complex submission validation
- Performance with many submissions
- Storage capacity management
- Security vulnerabilities

## Documentation

- Provide user guide for students
- Document submission rules and APIs
- Include system architecture diagrams
- Document security measures
- Include backup procedures

## Risk Assessment

- Risk: File upload failures
  - Impact: High
  - Probability: Medium
  - Mitigation: Implement retry mechanism, chunked uploads
- Risk: Storage capacity issues
  - Impact: High
  - Probability: Low
  - Mitigation: Implement storage monitoring, cleanup policies

## Progress Tracking

- Use story points for tracking
- Regular updates in sprint reviews
- Track completion percentage
- Monitor performance metrics
- Document implementation patterns

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Tests passed
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Security audit completed
