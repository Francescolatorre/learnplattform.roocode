## Context

### Problem Statement
While we have Task Documentation Standards (ADR-019), we lack a comprehensive Definition of Done (DoD) that ensures all tasks meet consistent quality and completeness criteria before being marked as complete. This leads to:

- Inconsistent task completion standards
- Missing documentation updates
- Incomplete scope coverage (as seen in TASK-042)
- Variable quality assurance across tasks

### Impact Scope
- All development tasks and features
- Quality assurance processes
- Documentation maintenance
- Code review standards
- Deployment readiness

---

## Decision

We establish a comprehensive Definition of Done that must be satisfied before any task can be marked as COMPLETED.

## Definition of Done Checklist

### üîß **Implementation Requirements**

#### Code Quality
- [ ] **Code Standards**: Code follows established coding standards and style guides
- [ ] **Code Review**: All code has been peer-reviewed and approved
- [ ] **Pull Request Required**: Code review conducted via Pull Request with CI/CD pipeline validation (never raw branch review)
- [ ] **No Regressions**: Existing functionality remains unbroken
- [ ] **Performance**: Performance requirements met (no degradation without justification)
- [ ] **Security**: Security best practices followed, no new vulnerabilities introduced

#### Service Layer Architecture (TASK-012 Standards)
- [ ] **Modern Service Pattern**: New service implementations use ModernApiClient composition pattern (not multiple API instances)
- [ ] **Migration Compliance**: Service changes follow 3-phase migration strategy maintaining backward compatibility
- [ ] **Factory Pattern**: Complex service instantiation uses ServiceFactory for dependency injection
- [ ] **Performance Validation**: Service memory usage and performance improvements validated (target: 80% reduction vs legacy)
- [ ] **Documentation**: Service implementation documented in `frontend/src/services/README.md` with usage examples

#### Scope Coverage
- [ ] **Complete Implementation**: ALL affected interfaces/components updated
- [ ] **UI Navigation Audit**: All features accessible through intended user navigation paths (no zombie features)
- [ ] **Multi-Interface Coverage**: If feature spans multiple pages/interfaces, tested on ALL locations
- [ ] **Cross-Platform**: Feature works across all supported platforms/browsers
- [ ] **Role Coverage**: All user roles properly handled (permissions, UI, etc.)

### üß™ **Testing Requirements**

#### Automated Testing
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Adequate unit test coverage for new/modified code
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and services tested
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys covered by end-to-end tests (HARD GATE - no exceptions)
- [ ] **Regression Tests**: Existing tests still pass

#### Manual Testing
- [ ] **Feature Testing**: Feature manually tested by implementer
- [ ] **User Acceptance**: Feature tested from user perspective
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Edge cases and error scenarios tested
- [ ] **Cross-Browser**: Testing completed on supported browsers (if UI changes)

### üìö **Documentation Requirements**

#### Technical Documentation
- [ ] **API Documentation**: API changes documented with examples
- [ ] **Architecture Updates**: Architecture diagrams/docs updated if applicable
- [ ] **Code Comments**: Complex logic appropriately commented
- [ ] **Configuration**: New configuration options documented

#### User Documentation
- [ ] **User Guides**: User-facing documentation created/updated
- [ ] **Feature Documentation**: How-to guides for new features
- [ ] **Release Notes**: User-visible changes documented for release
- [ ] **Migration Guides**: Breaking changes include migration instructions

#### Task Documentation
- [ ] **Task Specification**: Task documentation complete and accurate
- [ ] **Lessons Learned**: Scope issues or blockers documented for future prevention
- [ ] **Review Checklist**: Task-specific DoD items checked off
- [ ] **Cross-References**: Related tasks and documents properly linked

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database & Infrastructure**

#### Database Changes
- [ ] **Migrations**: Database migrations created and tested
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Migration rollback plan exists and tested
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: Data validation and constraints properly implemented
- [ ] **Performance**: Database performance impact assessed and acceptable

#### Infrastructure
- [ ] **Configuration**: Environment configuration changes documented
- [ ] **Deployment**: Deployment process updated if needed
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Logging/monitoring coverage adequate
- [ ] **Security**: Infrastructure security requirements met

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Compliance**

#### Security Validation
- [ ] **Access Control**: Role-based access control properly implemented
- [ ] **Data Protection**: Sensitive data properly protected
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All inputs properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant actions properly logged

#### Compliance
- [ ] **Privacy**: Privacy requirements met (GDPR, etc.)
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Accessibility standards followed (WCAG)
- [ ] **Legal**: Legal requirements met (if applicable)

## Task-Specific Extensions

### For UI/Frontend Tasks
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Works on all target screen sizes
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Screen readers and keyboard navigation work
- [ ] **Loading States**: Appropriate loading/error states implemented
- [ ] **Internationalization**: Text externalized for translation (if applicable)

### For API/Backend Tasks  
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP codes
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting implemented where appropriate
- [ ] **Caching**: Caching strategy implemented where beneficial
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Appropriate metrics and logging added

### For Database Tasks
- [ ] **Indexing**: Appropriate database indexes created
- [ ] **Constraints**: Data integrity constraints implemented
- [ ] **Backup**: Backup strategy accounts for new data
- [ ] **Archive Strategy**: Data archival/cleanup strategy defined

---

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Completion Review
Before marking a task as COMPLETED, conduct this review:

1. **Self-Assessment**: Task implementer reviews DoD checklist
2. **Peer Review**: Another team member validates completion
3. **Testing Validation**: QA validates testing requirements
4. **Documentation Review**: Technical writer validates documentation (if available)

### Completion Criteria Exceptions
In rare cases, DoD items may be deferred with:
- **Explicit justification** in task documentation
- **Follow-up task created** for deferred items
- **Risk assessment** of deferring the item
- **Approval from tech lead or product owner**

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Task Creators
- Include task-specific DoD items in task specification
- Reference this DoD in task template
- Ensure acceptance criteria align with DoD requirements

### For Implementers
- Review DoD before starting implementation
- Track DoD compliance during development
- Update DoD checklist items as they're completed
- Raise blockers if DoD cannot be met

### For Reviewers
- Validate DoD compliance during code review
- Ensure documentation requirements are met
- Check that testing requirements are satisfied
- Verify scope coverage is complete

## Examples

### Example: TASK-042 DoD Compliance
This task demonstrates full DoD compliance:
- ‚úÖ Implementation: Complete scope coverage (both UI interfaces)
- ‚úÖ Testing: Comprehensive E2E tests for both interfaces
- ‚úÖ Documentation: User guide created, technical docs updated
- ‚úÖ Security: Role-based access control, audit logging
- ‚úÖ Database: Migrations created, soft delete implemented
- ‚úÖ Lessons Learned: Scope discovery issue documented with prevention measures

### Example: Incomplete DoD
A task would NOT be complete if:
- ‚ùå Only implemented feature on one UI interface (scope miss)
- ‚ùå No user documentation provided
- ‚ùå E2E tests missing
- ‚ùå Security review not conducted
- ‚ùå Database migration not created
