## Student Progress Protection

### Why Some Tasks Cannot Be Deleted

The system protects student work by preventing deletion of tasks that students have started. This ensures:

- **No lost progress** - Students keep their work
- **Academic integrity** - Grades and submissions are preserved  
- **Consistent experience** - Students see tasks they've engaged with

### Detailed Progress Information

When you hover over the ‚ÑπÔ∏è info icon, you'll see exactly why deletion is blocked:

- `"Cannot delete: 3 students in progress"`
- `"Cannot delete: 2 students completed"`  
- `"Cannot delete: 1 student in progress and 2 completed"`

---

## Deletion Confirmation Process

### What Happens When You Click Delete

1. **Confirmation Dialog** appears with:
   - Task title for verification
   - "Are you sure?" message
   - Warning that action cannot be undone
   
2. **Two Options**:
   - **Delete Task** (red button) - Confirms deletion
   - **Cancel** (gray button) - Aborts deletion

3. **After Confirmation**:
   - Task is immediately removed from your view
   - Success notification appears
   - Task becomes unavailable to new students
   - Students who started it can still see it (in their view only)

---

## Security & Audit Features

### Deletion Permissions
- ‚úÖ **Course Instructors** - Can delete tasks in their courses
- ‚úÖ **Admins** - Can delete any task
- ‚ùå **Students** - Cannot see or use delete buttons
- ‚ùå **Other Instructors** - Cannot delete tasks in courses they don't teach

### Audit Logging
Every deletion attempt is logged with:
- **Who** performed the action
- **When** it occurred  
- **Which task** was affected
- **Success or failure** status
- **Reason for failure** (if blocked)

> **Note**: Audit logs are available to administrators for compliance and troubleshooting.

## Best Practices

### Before Deleting Tasks
1. **Double-check** the task title in the confirmation dialog
2. **Consider editing** instead of deleting if content needs minor changes
3. **Communicate** with students if the task was visible to them
4. **Have a backup** of task content if you might need it later

### Task Management Workflow
1. **Create tasks** early in course planning
2. **Test tasks** before students access them
3. **Edit** tasks for minor corrections
4. **Delete** only tasks that are truly unnecessary
5. **Use both pages** based on your current workflow needs

### Student Communication
When deleting tasks that students may have seen:
- **Announce** the change in your course announcements
- **Explain** why the task is no longer needed
- **Provide alternatives** if the learning objective remains important

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see a delete button"
**Possible causes**:
- Students have started the task (check for ‚ÑπÔ∏è info icon)
- You don't have instructor permissions for this course
- The task is already deleted

**Solution**: Hover over any icons to see detailed status information.

### "Delete button doesn't work"
**Possible causes**:
- A student started the task between page load and your click
- Network connectivity issues
- Browser cache issues

**Solution**: Refresh the page and try again. If the ‚ÑπÔ∏è icon now appears, a student has started the task.

### "Task still appears after deletion"
**Possible causes**:
- Browser cache hasn't refreshed
- Multiple browser tabs open

**Solution**: Refresh the page or close and reopen the tab.
