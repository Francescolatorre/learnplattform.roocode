- [ ] Basic command line usage
- [ ] Understanding of environment variables
- [ ] Familiarity with our Django + React application

## Training Modules

### Module 1: Understanding Cloud Test Environments (30 minutes)

#### What are Cloud Test Environments?
Cloud test environments provide isolated, production-like environments for testing changes before they reach production. Our setup includes:

- **Vercel**: Hosts frontend and provides serverless backend
- **Neon**: Serverless PostgreSQL database with branching
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline

#### Benefits
- âœ… **Isolated Testing**: Each PR gets its own environment
- âœ… **Production-like**: Real cloud infrastructure, not local
- âœ… **Automated**: Created and cleaned up automatically
- âœ… **Collaborative**: Easy sharing with team members
- âœ… **Fast Feedback**: Quick deployment and testing cycles

#### Architecture Overview
```
Feature Branch â†’ Pull Request â†’ Preview Environment
                                â”œâ”€â”€ Neon Database Branch
                                â””â”€â”€ Vercel Preview Deployment
```

### Module 2: CLI Tools Setup (45 minutes)

#### Install Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g vercel@latest

# Verify installation
vercel --version

# Login to Vercel
vercel login
```

#### Install Neon CLI
```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g neonctl

# Verify installation
neonctl --version

# Authenticate (requires API key from instructor)
neonctl auth
```

#### Test CLI Access
```bash
# Test Vercel access
vercel projects ls

# Test Neon access
neonctl projects list
```

**âœ… Checkpoint**: Verify both CLIs work before proceeding.

### Module 3: Feature Development Workflow (60 minutes)

#### Step 1: Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Start from main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch (follow naming convention)
git checkout -b feature/TASK-XXX-your-feature-description
```

#### Step 2: Make Changes
1. Implement your feature in the appropriate files
2. Write/update tests as needed
3. Test locally:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   source .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
   python manage.py runserver

   # Frontend (new terminal)
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Step 3: Push and Create PR
```bash
# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "TASK-XXX: Brief description of changes"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/TASK-XXX-your-feature-description
```

#### Step 4: Create Pull Request
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Fill out PR template:
   - **Title**: `TASK-XXX: Brief description`
   - **Description**: What changed and why
   - **Testing**: How to test the changes

#### Step 5: Wait for Preview Environment
- GitHub Actions automatically creates preview environment
- Takes ~3-5 minutes for full deployment
- PR comment will include preview URL and test credentials

#### Step 6: Test Preview Environment
1. Click preview URL from PR comment
2. Test your changes thoroughly
3. Use provided test credentials:
   - Student: `student` / `student123`
   - Instructor: `instructor` / `instructor123`

**ðŸŽ¯ Exercise**: Create a simple feature branch, make a small change, and create a PR to see the preview environment in action.

### Module 4: Testing and Validation (45 minutes)

#### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Preview URL loads correctly
- [ ] Your feature works as expected
- [ ] Authentication works with test credentials
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile
- [ ] Performance feels acceptable

#### Automated Testing
The CI pipeline runs these tests automatically:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components/functions
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints and services
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Preview Tests**: Smoke tests against preview environment

#### Validation Script
Run comprehensive validation manually:
```bash
# Basic health check
python scripts/validate_cloud_environment.py --environment staging --health-only

# Comprehensive testing (includes performance and security)
python scripts/validate_cloud_environment.py --environment staging --comprehensive
```

#### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Build Failure** | No preview URL in PR | Check GitHub Actions logs, fix build errors |
| **Database Error** | 500 errors on preview | Check database migrations, verify connection |
| **Environment Variables** | Features not working | Verify env vars are set in Vercel |
| **Slow Loading** | Preview takes too long | Check performance, optimize if needed |

**ðŸŽ¯ Exercise**: Run validation script against an existing preview environment and interpret the results.

### Module 5: Debugging and Troubleshooting (30 minutes)

#### Accessing Logs

1. **GitHub Actions Logs**:
   - Go to PR â†’ "Checks" tab
   - Click on failing job to see logs

2. **Vercel Deployment Logs**:
   ```bash
   vercel logs YOUR_PREVIEW_URL
   ```

3. **Local Debugging**:
   ```bash
   # Test with preview environment variables
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-preview.vercel.app npm run dev
   ```

#### Common Debugging Steps
1. **Check Build Logs**: First place to look for issues
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required vars are set
3. **Test Database Connection**: Use provided connection string
4. **Check API Endpoints**: Use browser dev tools or curl
5. **Validate Frontend Build**: Ensure assets are generated correctly

#### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# If preview environment is broken, clean up and retry
neonctl branches delete pr-123 --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Manually trigger new deployment
vercel deploy
```

**ðŸŽ¯ Exercise**: Intentionally break something small and practice debugging it.

### Module 6: Collaboration and Code Review (30 minutes)

#### Using Preview Environments for Review
- **Share Preview URL**: Include in PR description or Slack
- **Test Different Scenarios**: Create test data, test edge cases
- **Performance Testing**: Check loading times, responsiveness
- **Cross-browser Testing**: Test in different browsers if needed

#### Providing Feedback
- **Specific Issues**: Include steps to reproduce
- **Screenshots**: Visual issues are easier with images
- **Test Credentials**: Always use provided test accounts
- **Environment Context**: Mention if issue is environment-specific

#### Reviewer Checklist
- [ ] Preview environment loads correctly
- [ ] Feature works as described in PR
- [ ] No obvious bugs or usability issues
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Automated tests are passing
- [ ] Code follows team standards

**ðŸŽ¯ Exercise**: Review a teammate's PR using their preview environment.

### Module 7: Advanced Features (30 minutes)

#### Manual Environment Management
```bash
# Create database branch for long-running feature
python scripts/setup_neon_branch.py --branch-name feature-xyz --env-file

# Deploy custom preview
vercel deploy --env DATABASE_URL="your-custom-db-url"
```

#### Performance Optimization
- **Bundle Analysis**: Use Vercel's bundle analyzer
- **Database Optimization**: Monitor Neon metrics
- **Caching**: Leverage Vercel's edge caching

#### Environment-Specific Configuration
- **Staging**: More production-like settings
- **Preview**: Debug mode enabled, test data
- **Production**: Optimized for performance and security

**ðŸŽ¯ Exercise**: Create a manual database branch and deploy a custom preview environment.
