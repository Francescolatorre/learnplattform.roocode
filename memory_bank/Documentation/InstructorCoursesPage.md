# InstructorCoursesPage Component Documentation

## Introduction

The `InstructorCoursesPage` component is designed for instructors to manage their courses. It displays courses that the instructor has created, with options to view, edit, and create courses.

## Refactoring Process

The component was refactored to improve code structure, enhance performance, and add new functionalities. Key changes include the introduction of hooks for managing state and lifecycle methods for logging component activities.

## New Structure

- **State Management**: Utilizes `useState` for managing view mode, current page, page size, and total pages.
- **Lifecycle Methods**: `useEffect` is used for logging component mount and unmount activities, fetching courses, handling API errors, and updating courses data.
- **Functions**: Introduced `handlePageChange` and `handleViewModeChange` for managing pagination and view mode changes.

## Significant Changes in Functionality

- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling with notifications for users when API errors occur.
- **Pagination**: Improved pagination logic to reset to page 1 when invalid pages are requested.
- **View Mode**: Added functionality to switch between grid and list views for displaying courses.

## Conclusion

The refactoring of the `InstructorCoursesPage` component has resulted in a more structured and efficient codebase, with improved functionality and user experience. Future improvements may focus on further optimizing API calls and enhancing UI components.
