# Architectural Decision Record: Standardize Import Paths in Frontend Project

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The frontend project exhibits inconsistencies in import paths, leading to ESLint errors and potential runtime issues. This lack of standardization hinders code maintainability and scalability.

## Decision

Implement a systematic approach to identify and rectify incorrect import paths, ensuring consistency across the codebase. The following algorithm will be used:

1. **Analyze the error message:** Extract the module name and the file where the error occurs from the ESLint error message.
2. **Search for the module declaration:** Use the `search_files` tool to search for the module's declaration (e.g., function, class, interface) within the `frontend/src` directory. This will help identify the correct file path for the module.
3. **Determine the correct import path:** Based on the search results, determine the correct relative or absolute import path.
4. **Update the import statement:** Use the `apply_diff` tool to update the import statement in the file with the correct path.
5. **Verify the fix:** After applying the change, assume the terminal executed the command successfully and proceed with the task.
6. **Repeat steps 1-5** for all remaining ESLint errors.

## Consequences

* **Positive:** Improved code maintainability, reduced ESLint errors, enhanced code scalability, and a more consistent codebase.
* **Negative:** May require significant time investment to correct all import paths, potential for introducing new errors during the correction process.
