## Sprint Planning Capacity

### Standard Sprint Capacity Allocation

```
Total Capacity: 24 story points
├── P1 High Priority: 16 points (67%)
├── P2 Medium Priority: 5 points (21%)
├── P3 Low Priority/Buffer: 2 points (8%)
└── Emergency Reserve: 1 point (4%)
```

### Capacity Adjustment Scenarios
