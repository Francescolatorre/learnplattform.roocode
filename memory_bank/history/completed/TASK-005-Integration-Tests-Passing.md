## [AGENT UPDATE] - Failure Analysis

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### Failed Tests Detail

#### Test File: frontend/src/services/resources/enrollmentService.int.test.ts

- **Status**: FAILED
- **Error Type**: Import Error
- **Error Message**: TypeError: courseService.setAuthToken is not a function

```
TypeError: courseService.setAuthToken is not a function
    at setupUserAuthentication (frontend/src/services/resources/enrollmentService.int.test.ts:91:18)
    at Object.<anonymous> (frontend/src/services/resources/enrollmentService.int.test.ts:40:11)
```

- **Root Cause**: Incorrect import of courseService as default import when it's exported as a named export
- **Proposed Fix**: Change `import courseService from './courseService';` to `import { courseService } from './courseService';`
- **Priority**: HIGH

## [AGENT UPDATE] - Task Completion Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

### Achievement Summary

- **Tests Discovered**: 7 files (28 tests)
- **Tests Fixed**: 28
- **Tests Passing**: 28/28 (100%)
- **Files Modified**: 2
- **Environment Issues Resolved**: 0
- **Time Spent**: ~30 minutes

### Key Accomplishments

1. Identified the root cause of test failures: incorrect import statements for courseService
2. Fixed import statements in two test files to use named imports instead of default imports
3. Verified all tests now pass with 100% success rate (28/28 tests)

### Lessons Learned

1. Export/import mismatches are a common source of errors in TypeScript projects, especially when mixing named and default exports
2. Integration tests are particularly sensitive to these issues as they often depend on multiple services working together
3. Diagnostic logging in tests (like the console.log statements showing object types) was crucial for identifying the issue

### Recommendations for Future

1. Consider adding ESLint rules to enforce consistent import/export patterns across the codebase
2. Add more explicit type checking in test setup to catch these issues earlier
3. Document the export pattern for services in the project's coding standards to prevent similar issues

## Safety Procedures

### Rollback Commands

```bash
# If you need to rollback changes
git checkout HEAD -- frontend/vitest.integration.config.ts
git checkout HEAD -- frontend/package.json
git stash # to save any test file changes
```

### Validation Before Changes

- Always run `npm run test:unit` to ensure unit tests still pass
- Validate config syntax: `node -c frontend/vitest.integration.config.ts`
- Check TypeScript: `npx tsc --noEmit --project frontend/tsconfig.json`

## Agent Success Criteria

- [x] All sections marked `[AGENT UPDATE]` are completed
- [x] Final test run shows 100% pass rate
- [x] No unintentional test skips
- [x] All discovered test files are executed
- [x] Task completion summary is filled out
- [x] Document is self-contained with all findings

**Remember**: Update this document in real-time as you work. This is your workspace and final deliverable.
