# Workflow Procedures for Learning Platform Backlog

## Overview
This document defines the standard workflow procedures for managing tasks, epics, and sprints in the Learning Platform project. It ensures consistent processes across the development team and clear expectations for all stakeholders.

## Task Lifecycle Management

### 1. Task Creation Process

#### New Task Submission
1. **Use Template:** Start with `templates/task-template.md`
2. **Assign ID:** Use next available TASK-XXX number
3. **Complete Required Fields:**

   - Acceptance criteria (minimum 3 specific criteria)
   - Technical requirements breakdown
   - Effort estimation with justification
4. **Assessment:** Technical lead reviews architecture impact
5. **Prioritization:** Product owner assigns priority using guidelines
6. **Placement:** Move to appropriate priority folder

#### Task ID Management
- **Format:** TASK-XXX (3-digit sequential numbers)
- **Current Range:** Check highest existing number in all folders

### 2. Task Status Management

#### Status Flow
```
[Ready] → [In Progress] → [In Review] → [Done]
    ↓         ↓             ↓
[Blocked] → [Blocked] → [Blocked]
```

#### Status Definitions

4. **Reassignment:** Communicate changes to team and update documentation

## Epic Management

### Epic Creation and Planning
1. **Business Case:** Start with clear business problem and value
2. **Scope Definition:** Define what's in and out of scope explicitly
3. **Success Metrics:** Establish measurable success criteria

- **Monthly Stakeholder Updates:** Business value delivery status
- **Quarterly Planning:** Alignment with business objectives
- **Scope Management:** Change control process

## Sprint Workflow

### Sprint Planning Process
1. **Preparation (Day Before)**
   - Product owner reviews and prioritizes backlog
   - Team reviews upcoming tasks for readiness
   - Dependencies are identified and resolved

2. **Planning Session (2-4 hours)**
   - Review sprint goal and capacity
   - Select tasks using priority-first approach
   - Verify Definition of Ready for all selected tasks
   - Identify and plan for dependencies
   - Commit to sprint backlog

3. **Planning Outputs**
   - Completed sprint planning document
   - Task assignments
   - Risk mitigation plans
   - Communication agreements

### Daily Operations
#### Daily Standups (15 minutes max)
**Format:**
- What did I complete yesterday?
- What will I work on today?
- What blockers do I have?

**Focus Areas:**
- Progress toward sprint goal
- Task status updates
- Dependency coordination
- Risk identification

#### Task Management
- **Start of Day:** Check assigned tasks and priorities
- **End of Day:** Update task status and notes
- **Blockers:** Communicate immediately, don't wait for standup
- **Scope Changes:** Discuss with product owner before implementing

### Sprint Review and Retrospective
#### Sprint Review
- **Demo:** Show completed features to stakeholders
- **Metrics:** Review velocity and quality metrics
