## Business Context

GitHub Code Scanning has identified security vulnerabilities in the codebase that need to be addressed to maintain the security posture of the learning platform. These findings may include potential security weaknesses, code quality issues, and compliance violations that could pose risks to user data and system integrity.

---

## Requirements

### Security Objective

Systematically review and remediate all security findings identified by GitHub's automated code scanning tools to ensure the platform meets security best practices and compliance standards.

### User Stories

```gherkin
Feature: Security Vulnerability Remediation

  Scenario: Security team reviews code scanning findings
    Given I have access to GitHub Security tab
    And there are active code scanning alerts
    When I access the code scanning results at /security/code-scanning
    Then I can view all identified security issues
    And I can prioritize them by severity level

  Scenario: Developer remediates high-severity finding
    Given there is a high-severity security finding
    When I implement the recommended fix
    And I test the fix doesn't break functionality
    Then the security finding is marked as resolved
    And the fix is documented for future reference

  Scenario: Security compliance validation
    Given all code scanning findings have been addressed
    When I run the security scan again
    Then no critical or high-severity findings remain
    And the platform passes security compliance checks
```

## Technical Requirements

### Security Analysis Scope

1. **Static Code Analysis Findings**
   - Review all CodeQL alerts
   - Address dependency vulnerability alerts
   - Fix potential injection vulnerabilities
   - Resolve authentication/authorization issues

2. **Priority Classification**
   - **Critical**: Immediate remediation required
   - **High**: Address within current sprint
   - **Medium**: Address in next sprint
   - **Low**: Schedule for future maintenance

3. **Common Security Issues to Address**
   - SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention
   - Authentication bypass issues
   - Sensitive data exposure
   - Insecure dependencies
   - CSRF protection gaps

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Assessment Phase**
   - Catalog all findings from `/security/code-scanning`
   - Categorize by severity and impact
   - Identify false positives for dismissal

2. **Remediation Phase**
   - Implement fixes for critical/high findings first
   - Create secure coding patterns for common issues
   - Update dependencies to secure versions
   - Add security tests where appropriate

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Test all fixes don't break functionality
   - Run security scans to verify remediation
   - Document security improvements

## Success Criteria

### Definition of Done

- [ ] All critical and high-severity code scanning findings resolved
- [ ] Medium-severity findings have remediation plan
- [ ] Security fixes tested and validated
- [ ] False positives properly dismissed with documentation
- [ ] Security improvements documented in ADRs
- [ ] No regression in application functionality
- [ ] Code review completed for all security changes

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Security Metrics**
   - Zero critical security findings remaining
   - <5 high-severity findings (with justification for any remaining)
   - All dependency vulnerabilities addressed
   - Security scan shows improvement in overall score

2. **Documentation**
   - Security remediation decisions documented
   - ADRs created for significant security architecture changes
   - Developer security guidelines updated if needed

3. **Testing**
   - All existing tests pass
   - New security tests added where appropriate
   - Manual security testing completed for critical areas

## Dependencies

### Blocked By
- None (independent security task)

### Blocks
- Security compliance certification
- Production deployment approvals
- Dependency updates

### Related Tasks
- TASK-012-INFRA-TypeScript-Services-Standard (code quality standards)
- Any future security-related tasks

## Technical Notes

### Resources
- GitHub Security Tab: https://github.com/Francescolatorre/learnplattform.roocode/security/code-scanning
- OWASP Security Guidelines
- Django Security Documentation
- React Security Best Practices

### Risk Mitigation
- Create feature branch for security fixes
- Implement fixes incrementally
- Extensive testing before merging
- Rollback plan for any breaking changes

### Post-Implementation
- Set up regular security scanning schedule
- Establish security finding SLA response times
- Create security incident response procedures

---

## Notes

This task was created following the successful pipeline improvements in TASK-E2E-Pipeline-Issues to maintain the security foundation of the learning platform. Regular security reviews should be scheduled to prevent accumulation of security debt.

**GitHub Issue Reference**: Security findings available at `/security/code-scanning`
**Sprint Planning**: Recommended to break down into smaller sub-tasks by finding category during sprint planning.
