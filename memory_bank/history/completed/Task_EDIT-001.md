# Task: Task Editing & Deletion

## Task Metadata
- **Task-ID:** TASK-EDIT-001
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** High
- **Dependencies:** TASK-CREATION-001

## Description
Implement a comprehensive task editing and deletion system with robust permission controls and versioning.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Task Editing UI
   - Provide intuitive interface for task modification
   - Display current task details for editing
   - Validate input before submission

2. Permission-Based Editing
   - Enforce `can_manage_tasks` role check
   - Restrict editing to course-assigned instructors
   - Log all editing attempts for audit purposes

3. Soft Deletion Mechanism
   - Implement soft delete functionality
   - Retain task history
   - Mark deleted tasks as inactive
   - Support task recovery

### Technical Requirements
- Frontend: Create edit/delete modal or page
- Backend: Implement permission checks and versioning
- Database: Update task model to support soft delete and versioning

## Validation Criteria
- [x] Only authorized instructors can edit/delete tasks
- [x] Task edit history is preserved
- [x] Deleted tasks are hidden but recoverable
- [x] Versioning mechanism tracks all changes

## Implementation Notes
- Use Django model versioning or custom versioning logic
- Implement soft delete using `is_active` flag
- Create comprehensive audit logging

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Instructors can edit task details
2. Task edit history is maintained
3. Soft deletion works as expected
4. Unauthorized edit attempts are blocked

## Estimated Effort
- Frontend: 3 story points
- Backend: 5 story points
- Total: 8 story points

## Potential Risks
- Ensuring consistent permission checks
- Managing complex versioning logic
