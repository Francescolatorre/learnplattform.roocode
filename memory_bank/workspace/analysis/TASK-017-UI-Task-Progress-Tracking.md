   - [x] Completed

3. Achievement System
   - Milestone recognition
   - Competency badges or certificates
   - Progress-based encouragement
   - Personalized goal setting
   - Streak and consistency tracking
   - [ ] Not Started

4. Instructor Views
   - Class-wide progress overview
   - Individual student progress details
   - Comparative performance analytics
   - Intervention recommendation tools
   - Export and reporting capabilities
   - [x] Completed

## Implementation

### Current Status

- Progress dashboard component implemented with:
  - Student progress data and course structure fetching
  - Overall completion percentage display
  - Module completion visualization
  - Performance by task type visualization
  - Upcoming tasks display

### Technical Specifications

- React 18.0+
- TypeScript 4.9+
- React Router 6.8+
- Redux Toolkit 1.9+ or React Query 4.0+ for state management
- Material UI 5.11+ for UI components
- Chart.js 4.0+ or D3.js 7.0+ for data visualization
- date-fns 2.29+ for date handling
- socket.io-client 4.5+ for real-time updates (optional)

## Documentation

### Data Flow

- Student task submission data
- Task completion status
- Grading and feedback information
- Course structure and module organization
- Learning objectives and competencies

### Output Specifications

- Visual progress indicators
- Completion statistics
- Performance metrics
- Achievement notifications
- Personalized recommendations

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- Data visualization performance issues
- Complexity of real-time updates
- Accessibility challenges with interactive charts
- Browser compatibility issues with advanced visualizations
- Data synchronization issues between client and server

### Edge Cases

1. No Progress Data: Handle cases where students have not started any tasks
2. Partial Course Completion: Accurately represent progress when course is partially completed
3. Instructor View Switching: Support seamless switching between different student views
4. Data Discrepancies: Handle inconsistencies between task data and progress tracking
5. Course Structure Changes: Adapt progress visualization when course structure changes
