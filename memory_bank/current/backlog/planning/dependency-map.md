### Potential Upcoming Blockers

#### High Risk Blockers
1. **Modern Service Architecture Complexity**
   - **Risk**: TASK-027-B more complex than estimated
   - **Impact**: Delays all component migration tasks
   - **Mitigation**: Daily check-ins, scope reduction plan ready
   - **Contingency**: Parallel legacy support approach

2. **Database Performance Bottlenecks**
   - **Risk**: Query optimization insufficient for real-time features
   - **Impact**: Real-time progress updates may need architecture changes
   - **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarking, caching strategies
   - **Contingency**: Batch update approach with periodic sync

#### Medium Risk Blockers
1. **Third-party Service Stability**
   - **Risk**: External APIs for integrations unreliable
   - **Impact**: LTI, SCORM, and other integration tasks
   - **Mitigation**: Fallback providers, local alternatives
   - **Contingency**: Delayed integration rollout

2. **Mobile Framework Choice**
   - **Risk**: React Native vs. Progressive Web App decision
   - **Impact**: Mobile app development direction
   - **Mitigation**: Technical spike to evaluate options
   - **Contingency**: Web-first approach with mobile optimization

## Dependency Resolution Strategies

### Parallel Development
Where possible, work on independent tracks simultaneously:
- **Frontend-Backend Split**: UI work can proceed with mock data
- **Component Isolation**: Independent components can be developed in parallel
- **Testing Pipeline**: Quality improvements can proceed independently

### Incremental Delivery
Break large dependencies into smaller, deliverable pieces:
- **Modern Service Migration**: Component-by-component rather than all-at-once
- **Performance Optimization**: Database → API → Frontend optimization sequence
- **User Experience**: Feature-by-feature enhancement rather than complete redesign

### Risk Mitigation
Prepare alternatives for high-risk dependencies:
- **Technical Spikes**: Research alternatives before committing to approach
- **Proof of Concepts**: Validate complex integrations early
- **Rollback Plans**: Maintain ability to revert changes if dependencies fail

## Dependency Tracking Process

### Daily Monitoring
- **Standup Reviews**: Check for new blockers or dependency changes
- **Progress Updates**: Verify dependent tasks are on track
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential upcoming blockers

### Weekly Dependency Review
- **Dependency Map Updates**: Reflect current reality and new information
- **Risk Level Adjustments**: Update based on progress and learnings
- **Mitigation Planning**: Prepare contingencies for identified risks

### Sprint Planning Integration
- **Dependency Validation**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are completed
- **Risk-Based Scheduling**: Prioritize high-risk dependencies
- **Parallel Path Planning**: Identify work that can proceed independently

## Tools and Automation

### Dependency Tracking Tools
- **Task Management**: Links between tasks in backlog system
- **Visual Mapping**: Mermaid diagrams for complex relationships
- **Status Automation**: Automatic updates when prerequisite tasks complete

### Alerting and Notifications
- **Blocker Alerts**: Immediate notification when tasks become blocked
- **Dependency Completion**: Notify dependent task owners when prerequisites finish
- **Risk Escalation**: Automatic escalation for high-risk dependency delays

## Success Metrics

### Dependency Health Indicators
- **Blocker Duration**: Average time tasks spend in blocked status
- **Critical Path Adherence**: Percentage of critical path tasks completed on time
- **Dependency Accuracy**: Percentage of identified dependencies that prove accurate
- **Parallel Work Efficiency**: Story points completed in parallel vs. sequential work

### Process Improvement Metrics
- **Dependency Discovery**: How early in the process dependencies are identified
- **Risk Prediction**: Accuracy of risk assessments for dependency-related delays
- **Mitigation Effectiveness**: Success rate of contingency plans when activated

**Note**: This dependency map is a living document that should be updated as new dependencies are discovered and existing ones are resolved. Success depends on proactive identification and management of blocking relationships to maintain development velocity.
