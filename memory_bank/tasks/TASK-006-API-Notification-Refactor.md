## Description

The Notification System Refactor task aims to address several limitations in the current notification system implementation. While the existing system follows ADR-012 as a centralized notification system, it has naming inconsistencies, limited functionality, and scalability concerns. This task will implement a comprehensive improvement plan to enhance the notification system while maintaining backward compatibility.

The current notification system is implemented as a React Context-based solution with components named with an "Error" prefix despite handling multiple notification types (error, success, info, warning). This naming inconsistency creates confusion for developers and doesn't accurately reflect the system's capabilities. Additionally, the system has limited documentation, only displays one notification at a time, has testing gaps, and lacks notification management features like grouping, filtering, or persistence.

This task will implement a phased approach to refactor and enhance the notification system, addressing all identified limitations while ensuring backward compatibility with existing code.

## Requirements

1. Maintain backward compatibility with existing code that uses the notification system
2. Rename components to accurately reflect their purpose (from "Error" prefix to "Notification")
3. Enhance the notification system to support multiple visible notifications
4. Implement notification management features (grouping, filtering, persistence)
5. Improve performance and scalability for high-frequency notification scenarios
6. Expand test coverage to include edge cases, accessibility, and performance
7. Create comprehensive documentation with usage examples
8. Add inline JSDoc comments to all functions and interfaces
9. Implement a parallel approach with aliasing for backward compatibility
10. Add deprecation warnings for old APIs

## Implementation Details

The implementation will follow a phased approach to ensure a smooth transition from the current notification system to the enhanced version. Each phase builds upon the previous one, with a focus on maintaining backward compatibility throughout the process.

### Phase 1: Rename and Refactor

- Create new components with appropriate naming (NotificationProvider, NotificationToast, etc.)
- Refactor interfaces to better represent notification types
- Reorganize directory structure to reflect the broader notification system
- Implement aliasing to maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Add deprecation warnings to old components and functions

### Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality

- Implement a more robust state management solution for notifications
- Add configurable options for notification behavior (duration, position, etc.)
- Enhance the notification API with more capabilities (actions, callbacks, etc.)
- Support multiple visible notifications with proper stacking and positioning
- Implement notification priority levels

### Phase 3: Performance and Scalability

- Implement virtualization for handling large volumes of notifications
- Add throttling/debouncing for high-frequency notification scenarios
- Optimize state updates to minimize re-renders
- Implement notification grouping to prevent notification fatigue
- Add support for persistent notifications across page navigation

### Phase 4: Documentation and Testing

- Create detailed usage documentation with examples
- Add inline JSDoc comments to all functions and interfaces
- Expand test coverage to include edge cases, accessibility, and performance
- Create visual regression tests for notification components
- Document migration path from old API to new API

### Phase 5: Migration Strategy

- Develop a migration guide for transitioning from old API to new API
- Create automated migration scripts where possible
- Gradually update existing usage in the codebase
- Monitor and address any issues that arise during migration
- Complete removal of deprecated components after sufficient transition period

## Validation Criteria

1. All existing code using the notification system continues to work without modification
2. New notification system supports multiple visible notifications simultaneously
3. Notification management features (grouping, filtering, persistence) function as expected
4. Performance tests show improved handling of high-frequency notification scenarios
5. Test coverage reaches at least 90% for the notification system
6. Documentation is comprehensive and includes usage examples
7. All functions and interfaces have proper JSDoc comments
8. Deprecation warnings appear when using old APIs
9. Migration guide is clear and actionable
10. Visual appearance and accessibility meet design standards

## Subtasks

### Subtask-1: Rename and Refactor Components

- **ID:** NOTIFICATION-002-SUB-001
- **Status:** DONE
- **Estimated Hours:** 8
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Description:** Rename components to accurately reflect their purpose while maintaining backward compatibility. Create new components with appropriate naming (NotificationProvider, NotificationToast, etc.), refactor interfaces, reorganize directory structure, implement aliasing, and add deprecation warnings.
- **Validation:** All existing code continues to work without modification, new components function correctly, deprecation warnings appear when using old APIs.

**Progress Notes:** Subtask completed. All components are renamed to `Notification*` with backward compatibility exports under `Error*` names. Deprecation warnings are logged, tsconfig paths updated, and tests/docs reference the new provider.

### Subtask-2: Enhance Notification Functionality

- **Estimated Hours:** 10
- **Dependencies:** NOTIFICATION-002-SUB-001
- **Description:** Implement enhanced functionality including robust state management, configurable options, expanded API capabilities, support for multiple visible notifications, and notification priority levels.
- **Validation:** Multiple notifications display correctly, configuration options work as expected, API provides all required capabilities, priority levels function correctly.
**Progress Notes:** Added priority support, configurable provider options, and simultaneous notification display with stacking.

### Subtask-3: Improve Performance and Scalability

- **ID:** NOTIFICATION-002-SUB-003
- **Status:** DRAFT
- **Estimated Hours:** 12
- **Dependencies:** NOTIFICATION-002-SUB-002

## Status Roll-up Rules

1. Task is considered DONE when:
   - All subtasks are marked as DONE
   - All validation criteria are met
   - Required documentation is complete

2. Task Progress Calculation:
   - Completion % = (Completed Subtasks / Total Subtasks) * 100
   - Subtask weights are adjusted based on estimated hours

3. Status Inheritance Rules:
   - Parent task cannot be DONE if any subtask is not DONE
   - Parent task is IN_PROGRESS if any subtask is IN_PROGRESS
   - All subtasks inherit dependencies from parent task

4. Validation Requirements:
   - Each subtask must have defined validation criteria
   - Parent task validation must encompass subtask validations
   - Status changes require validation criteria check

## Potential Risks

- Breaking changes despite backward compatibility efforts
- Performance degradation during transition period
- Increased complexity with new features
- Resistance to adoption of new API
- Incomplete migration of existing code
- Notification fatigue with multiple visible notifications
- Increased bundle size with parallel implementations

## Notes

The notification system refactor is a critical improvement that will enhance the user experience and developer experience. By addressing the current limitations while maintaining backward compatibility, we can ensure a smooth transition to a more robust and scalable notification system.

The phased approach allows for incremental improvements and testing, reducing the risk of introducing breaking changes. Each phase builds upon the previous one, with a focus on maintaining backward compatibility throughout the process.

The end result will be a notification system that accurately reflects its purpose, provides enhanced functionality, performs well under high load, and is well-documented for developers.
