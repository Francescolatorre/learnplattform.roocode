# TASK-049: Migrate TaskStore to Modern Service Integration

## Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-049
**Title**: Migrate TaskStore to Modern Service Integration
**Type**: Technical Enhancement
**Priority**: P1 (High Priority)
**Story Points**: 5
**Sprint**: Phase 2 Modern Service Migration
**Dependencies**: TASK-012 (Modern Services), TASK-027-B (State Integration), TASK-048 (TaskCreation Migration)

## User Story
As a developer working with the Learning Platform,
I want the TaskStore to use modern service integration patterns,
So that all task-related state management follows the new architecture standards and benefits from improved performance and maintainability.

## Problem Statement
The current TaskStore implementation uses legacy service patterns that are inconsistent with the new modern service architecture established in TASK-012. This creates:
- Inconsistent service usage patterns across the codebase
- Potential performance issues due to legacy service overhead
- Technical debt that will become harder to resolve over time
- Risk of reverting to inferior legacy patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning
- [ ] **AC-1**: Analyze current TaskStore implementation and dependencies
- [ ] **AC-2**: Identify all components that consume TaskStore
- [ ] **AC-3**: Map out migration strategy following TASK-027-B patterns
- [ ] **AC-4**: Ensure backward compatibility during transition

### Phase 2: Modern Service Integration
- [ ] **AC-5**: Update TaskStore to use `modernLearningTaskService` instead of legacy service
- [ ] **AC-6**: Implement proper error handling using `withManagedExceptions`
- [ ] **AC-7**: Update all store actions to use modern service methods
- [ ] **AC-8**: Maintain existing store interface for consuming components

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- [ ] **AC-9**: Update all TaskStore unit tests to mock modern service
- [ ] **AC-10**: Ensure all existing TaskStore consumers continue to work
- [ ] **AC-11**: Verify performance improvements (memory usage, response times)
- [ ] **AC-12**: No regressions in task-related functionality

### Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] **AC-13**: Update TaskStore documentation to reflect modern patterns
- [ ] **AC-14**: Add migration notes for future store migrations
- [ ] **AC-15**: Remove any temporary legacy compatibility code

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Current State Analysis
The TaskStore currently imports from legacy service:
```typescript
// Current (Legacy)
import { fetchTasks, createTask, updateTask, deleteTask } from '@/services/resources/learningTaskService';
```

### Target State
TaskStore should use modern service integration:
```typescript
// Target (Modern)
import { modernLearningTaskService } from '@/services/resources/modernLearningTaskService';
```

### Migration Steps

#### Step 1: Service Import Migration
- Replace legacy service imports with modern service
- Update all service method calls to use modern service instance
- Ensure proper error handling with `withManagedExceptions`

#### Step 2: Store Action Updates
- Update `fetchTasks` action to use `modernLearningTaskService.getTasks()`
- Update `createTask` action to use `modernLearningTaskService.createTask()`
- Update `updateTask` action to use `modernLearningTaskService.updateTask()`
- Update `deleteTask` action to use `modernLearningTaskService.deleteTask()`

#### Step 3: Error Handling Enhancement
- Implement consistent error handling using modern service patterns
- Ensure proper error state management in the store
- Add appropriate loading states for async operations

#### Step 4: Test Migration
- Update all test mocks to use modern service
- Ensure test coverage remains at 100%
- Add integration tests for store-service interaction

## Files to Modify

### Primary Files
- `frontend/src/stores/taskStore.ts` - Main store implementation
- `frontend/src/stores/taskStore.test.ts` - Store unit tests

### Test Files
- Any integration tests that test TaskStore functionality
- Component tests that rely on TaskStore state

### Documentation Files
- Store architecture documentation (if exists)
- Migration guide updates

## Definition of Ready Checklist
- [x] User story is clearly defined
- [x] Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
- [x] Technical approach is planned
- [x] Dependencies are identified and resolved
- [x] Story points are estimated (5 points)
- [x] Architecture impact is assessed

## Definition of Done Checklist
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (100% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests updated and passing
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality
- [ ] Performance requirements met (memory reduction)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Modern service patterns followed consistently

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Store Consumer Compatibility**: Risk that components consuming TaskStore may break
  - *Mitigation*: Maintain existing store interface, comprehensive testing
- **Performance Impact**: Risk of temporary performance degradation during migration
  - *Mitigation*: Follow proven patterns from TASK-048, monitor performance

### Business Risks
- **Task Management Disruption**: Risk of breaking task creation/management workflows
  - *Mitigation*: Thorough testing of all task-related user journeys

## Success Metrics
- [ ] TaskStore uses modern service patterns (100% migration)
- [ ] All existing tests pass (100% pass rate)
- [ ] Performance improvement measurable (memory usage reduction)
- [ ] Zero regressions in task-related functionality
- [ ] Code follows established modern service patterns

## Notes
- This task is part of Phase 2 modern service migration
- Follows patterns established in TASK-048 (TaskCreation migration)
- Critical for preventing regression to legacy service patterns
- Should be completed before migrating components that heavily use TaskStore
