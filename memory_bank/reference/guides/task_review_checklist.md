## Task Definition Enhancement Guide

If a task definition is found to be insufficient during review, consider these enhancement strategies:

### Addressing Missing Information
1. **Consult with Task Author**: Schedule a brief meeting to clarify requirements and expectations
2. **Research Similar Tasks**: Look for patterns in well-defined similar tasks
3. **Review System Documentation**: Check architecture diagrams and technical specifications
4. **Prototype Key Components**: Create simple prototypes to validate assumptions

### Filling Knowledge Gaps
1. **Identify Learning Resources**: Find tutorials, documentation, or courses for unfamiliar technologies
2. **Schedule Knowledge Transfer**: Arrange sessions with subject matter experts
3. **Create Code Examples**: Develop sample code for complex components
4. **Document Domain Concepts**: Create or update glossary entries for domain terminology

### Improving Implementation Guidance
1. **Break Down Complex Steps**: Divide challenging components into smaller, manageable tasks
2. **Provide Alternative Approaches**: Document multiple implementation options with pros and cons
3. **Create Decision Trees**: Help implementers navigate complex decision points
4. **Add Validation Checkpoints**: Define intermediate validation steps for long-running tasks

### Enhancing Quality Assurance
1. **Define Test Scenarios**: Provide specific test cases for key functionality
2. **Create Test Data**: Provide sample data structures for testing
3. **Specify Performance Benchmarks**: Define clear performance expectations
4. **Document Security Requirements**: Specify security testing and validation approaches
