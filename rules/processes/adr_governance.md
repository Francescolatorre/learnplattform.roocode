# ADR Governance Standards

Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: 2025-06-11

## Overview

This document serves as the single source of truth for Architecture Decision Record (ADR) standards within the learning platform. It consolidates and supersedes ADR-related guidance previously distributed across multiple governance documents.

## Scope

Applies to all architectural decisions, their documentation, review processes, and lifecycle management within the system.

## ADR Structure and Organization

### Location and Naming

- All ADRs reside in `/memory_bank/ADRs/`
- Follow naming pattern: `ADR-[sequential number]-[descriptive-slug].md`
- Example: `ADR-016-CourseCreation-Component-Refactoring.md`

### Required Sections

1. **Title and Identifier**

   ```md
   # ADR-[number]: [Title]
   ```

2. **Metadata**

   ```md
   Version: X.Y.Z
   Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD
   Status: [Proposed|Accepted|Superseded|Deprecated]
   ```

3. **Context**
   - Problem statement
   - Current situation
   - Impact scope
   - Stakeholders affected

4. **Decision**
   - Chosen approach
   - Rationale
   - Implications
   - Constraints considered

5. **Consequences**
   - Benefits
   - Drawbacks
   - Technical impacts
   - Required changes

6. **Implementation**
   - Required steps
   - Dependencies
   - Migration plan (if applicable)
   - Validation criteria

7. **Related Documents**
   - Referenced ADRs
   - Impacted documentation
   - External resources

## Process Workflow

### 1. Creation

1. Identify need for architectural decision
2. Create new ADR using template
3. Assign sequential number
4. Set status as "Proposed"

### 2. Review

1. Technical assessment
2. Impact analysis
3. Stakeholder review
4. Security evaluation
5. Performance consideration

### 3. Approval

1. Architecture review
2. Stakeholder sign-off
3. Update status to "Accepted"
4. Version number assignment

### 4. Implementation

1. Execute required changes
2. Update affected documentation
3. Validate implementation
4. Record completion

### 5. Maintenance

1. Regular review cycles
2. Update as needed
3. Version management
4. Status updates

## Quality Criteria

### Documentation Standards

1. Clear and concise language
2. Complete context description
3. Well-reasoned decisions
4. Thorough impact analysis
5. Implementation guidance

### Technical Requirements

1. Alignment with system architecture
2. Security consideration
3. Performance impacts documented
4. Scalability analysis
5. Maintenance implications

### Review Requirements

1. Architecture review completed
2. Security assessment done
3. Performance evaluation
4. Implementation feasibility
5. Risk assessment

## Version Control

### Version Numbering

Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- MAJOR: Breaking architectural changes
- MINOR: Backwards-compatible additions
- PATCH: Documentation updates/clarifications

### Status Tracking

- **Proposed**: Initial draft
- **Accepted**: Approved for implementation
- **Superseded**: Replaced by newer ADR
- **Deprecated**: No longer applicable

## Review and Approval Procedures

### Review Process

1. Technical review by architecture team
2. Security review (if applicable)
3. Stakeholder consultation
4. Implementation assessment
5. Final architecture approval

### Approval Requirements

1. Complete documentation
2. Impact assessment
3. Implementation plan
4. Risk evaluation
5. Stakeholder sign-off

## Cross-Reference Management

### Internal References

- Use relative paths for links
- Reference related ADRs explicitly
- Maintain bidirectional references
- Update all affected documents

### External References

- Document external dependencies
- Link to relevant standards
- Reference technical specifications
- Cite industry best practices

## Template

```md
# ADR-[number]: [Title]

## Metadata
Version: 1.0.0
Status: Proposed
Last Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
[Problem description and background]

## Decision
[Chosen approach and rationale]

## Consequences
[Impact and implications]

## Implementation
[Execution plan and steps]

## Enforcement

Violations of ADR governance standards should be reported through the established escalation procedures. All architectural decisions must be documented following these guidelines to ensure system integrity and maintainability.
