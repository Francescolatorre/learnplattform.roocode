# TASK-TYPE-001: Text Submission Task Type

## Description
Implement the Text Submission Task Type to support text-based submissions within the LearningTask model. This involves designing the necessary fields, validation, and submission handling for text submissions.

## Objectives
- [x] Design and implement fields specific to text submissions
- [x] Ensure robust validation for text content
- [x] Integrate with the existing LearningTask model
- [x] Develop test cases to validate functionality

## Implementation Details
- Added `text_submission_config` JSONField for flexible configuration
- Implemented `min_word_count` and `max_word_count` constraints
- Created `validate_text_submission()` method to check submission validity
- Extended model validation to handle text submission-specific constraints

## Dependencies
- TASK-MODEL-CONSOLIDATION-EXTEND (Completed)

## Status
- DONE

## Assigned To
- Architect

## Priority
- High

## Context
- Part of the comprehensive learning task management system
- Supports modular and scalable architecture
- Enhances the flexibility of the task type framework

## Next Steps
- [x] Define fields and validation for text submissions
- [x] Implement text submission handling in the LearningTask model
- [x] Develop test cases for text submission functionality
- Review implementation with the team
