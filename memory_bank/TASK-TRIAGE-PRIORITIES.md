### **BLOCKED UNTIL TIER 1 COMPLETION**
- All 39 backlog tasks
- New feature development
- Non-critical enhancements

---

## CAPACITY MANAGEMENT

### **CURRENT WORKLOAD ASSESSMENT**
- **Before Triage**: 44 active tasks (UNSUSTAINABLE)
- **After Triage**: 5 critical tasks (MANAGEABLE)
- **Capacity Utilization**: ~80% on critical items (HEALTHY)

### **RESOURCE ALLOCATION**
- **Bug Fixing**: 40% (TASK-041 critical defect)
- **Infrastructure**: 30% (TASK-044 E2E, TASK-043 Security) 
- **Feature Development**: 20% (TASK-042 UI)
- **Maintenance**: 10% (TASK-012 Standards)

## BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION

### **WHY THIS BRUTAL CUT IS NECESSARY:**
1. **Focus**: 44 tasks = scattered attention, 5 tasks = focused delivery
2. **Quality**: Better to deliver 5 excellent solutions than 44 mediocre attempts
3. **Velocity**: Completion of critical items unblocks broader development
4. **Risk Management**: Address highest business risks first

### **EXPECTED OUTCOMES:**
- **Week 1**: Critical defect resolved, instructor workflow restored
- **Week 2**: E2E pipeline stable, security hardened
- **Week 3**: Complete instructor task management flow
- **Month 1**: Rock-solid foundation for future feature development

---

## PMO ENFORCEMENT

### **TASK INTAKE FREEZE**
- **NO NEW TASKS** until Tier 1 completion
- **NO TASK ADDITIONS** without PMO approval
- **NO SCOPE CREEP** on active tasks

### **PROGRESS MONITORING**
- **Daily standups** focus ONLY on Tier 1 tasks
- **Weekly reviews** of critical path progress
- **Monthly reassessment** of backlog priorities

### **COMPLETION CRITERIA**
Each Tier 1 task must achieve:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Tests passing (unit + integration minimum)
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No regression issues

---

## COMMUNICATION PLAN

### **STAKEHOLDER MESSAGING**
- **Development Team**: Focus on critical path, ignore backlog noise
- **Business Stakeholders**: Clear delivery timeline for essential features
- **QA Team**: Prioritize testing on Tier 1 items only

### **BACKLOG COMMUNICATION**
"Tasks in Tier 2 backlog are preserved but NOT ACTIVE until critical issues resolved. This ensures delivery quality and timeline predictability."

**PMO SIGNATURE**: Governance Cleanup Phase 1 - COMPLETE**
**Next Review**: After Tier 1 task completion or 30 days, whichever comes first
