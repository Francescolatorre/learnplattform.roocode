## PMO EMERGENCY DIRECTIVE

**Date:** 2025-09-08
**Status:** CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
**Severity:** GOVERNANCE DEBT CRISIS

---

## CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

### CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

1. **DOCUMENT EXPLOSION**
   - 175 governance documents (UNSUSTAINABLE)
   - 44 active tasks vs 2 completed (2200% overcommitment)
   - Broken references between documents
   - No document lifecycle management

2. **INCONSISTENT NAMING**
   - activeContext.md references: `TASK-UI-001-DESIGN-TASK-MANAGEMENT.md`
   - Actual tasks follow: `TASK-001-UI-Student-Course-Interaction-Journey.md`
   - **COMPLETE NAMING CONVENTION BREAKDOWN**

3. **OUTDATED TRACKING**
   - activeContext.md claims "Implementation & Refactoring" phase
   - Reality: Just completed major pipeline/security work
   - **GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTS DON'T REFLECT ACTUAL WORK**

4. **TASK OVERLOAD**
   - 42 tasks in backlog (impossible to manage)
   - No prioritization or realistic capacity planning
   - **SETUP FOR FAILURE**
