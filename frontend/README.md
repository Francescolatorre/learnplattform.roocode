# Frontend Architecture Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural improvements made to the frontend React TypeScript codebase, focusing on reducing code duplication, improving reusability, and enhancing overall code quality.

## TypeScript Services Standardization

This project enforces the [TypeScript Services Standardization Initiative](../memory_bank/tasks/Task_TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001.md) to ensure all TypeScript service modules are consistent, maintainable, and well-documented.

### Key Requirements

- **Naming:** Service files/folders must follow the `*Service.ts` convention.
- **API:** All public service methods must be async, have explicit return types, and follow a unified API signature.
- **Documentation:** All public classes and methods in services require JSDoc/TSDoc.
- **Dependency Pattern:** Use dependency injection or the standardized pattern for service dependencies.
- **Testing:** Unit tests are required for all service methods, with a minimum 80% coverage.
- **Domain Logic:** Service modules must only contain domain-relevant logic.
- **Documentation:** Service documentation must be up-to-date and accessible.
- **Lint/Format:** Code must pass all linting and formatting checks.

### Enforcement

- **Linting:** Automated via ESLint rules (see `eslint.config.js`).
- **Code Review:** Enforced via [Pull Request Checklist](../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
- **Full Standard:** See [memory_bank/drafts/typescript_services_standardization.md](../memory_bank/drafts/typescript_services_standardization.md) for detailed guidelines and migration instructions.

## Shared UI Components

### 1. DataTable

A flexible, generic table component with:

- Dynamic column configuration
- Pagination support
- Loading and error states
- Customizable styling
- Type-safe generic implementation

### 2. StatusChip

An intelligent status indicator component featuring:

- Automatic color mapping
- Customizable status representations
- Flexible labeling
- Consistent theming

### 3. ProgressIndicator

A versatile progress visualization component with:

- Linear and circular progress modes
- Intelligent color coding
- Configurable thresholds
- Responsive design

## API Layer Improvements

### 1. ApiService

A centralized API management solution providing:

- Automatic token management
- Comprehensive error handling
- Resource-specific service creation
- Type-safe generic methods
- Flexible configuration

### 2. useApiResource Hook

A powerful hook factory for:

- Generic resource management
- Automatic state handling
- CRUD operations
- Type-safe implementations
- Caching and performance optimization

### 3. useCourseData Hook

A comprehensive course data management hook with:

- Full course lifecycle operations
- Enrollment management
- React Query integration
- Automatic state and error handling

## Key Benefits

- **Reduced Code Duplication:** Centralized, reusable components
- **Improved Type Safety:** TypeScript generics
- **Enhanced Performance:** Optimized data fetching and caching
- **Consistent User Experience:** Standardized UI components
- **Flexible Architecture:** Easily extensible design

## Best Practices Implemented

- Modular component design
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization
- Type-safe implementations
- Consistent theming and styling

## Getting Started

1. Explore shared components in `src/components/common/`
2. Review API services in `src/services/`
3. Utilize hooks in `src/hooks/`

## Future Improvements

- Expand component library
- Add more comprehensive testing
- Implement advanced caching strategies
- Enhance type definitions

## Contributing

Please follow our coding guidelines and contribute to improving the frontend architecture.

## Documentation Updates

### Refactored Hooks

The following hooks have been refactored to improve usability and maintainability:

- **useApiResource**: Enhanced to support automatic state handling and CRUD operations with type-safe implementations.
- **useCourseData**: Updated to integrate with React Query for better data management and error handling.

Ensure that all examples and usage instructions reflect these changes for clarity and consistency.
