# Backlog Management System

## Overview

This directory contains the structured task backlog and queue mechanism for the Learning Platform project. It provides prioritized task management, sprint planning, dependency tracking, and status workflows for the Django REST + React TypeScript architecture.

## Integration with Existing System

### Memory Bank Compatibility
- Maintains existing `memory_bank/current/`, `memory_bank/reference/`, and `memory_bank/history/` structure
- Works alongside existing ADR (Architecture Decision Records) system
- Integrates with `memory_bank/workspace/analysis/` for task elaboration

### CLAUDE.md Development Workflow
- Aligns with feature branch strategy: `feature/TASK-XXX-description`
- Supports TASK-XXX naming convention
- Integrates with git workflow and commit message standards
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing task references

### TypeScript Service Modernization (TASK-012)
- Supports Phase 2 gradual adoption planning
- Tracks modern service migration priorities
- Aligns with ServiceFactory and composition patterns
- Monitors performance improvement tasks

## Quick Start

1. **View Current Sprint**: Check `active/current-sprint.md` for in-progress work
2. **Add New Task**: Use appropriate template from `templates/` directory
3. **Prioritize Task**: Place in correct priority file (`p0-critical.md` to `p3-low.md`)
4. **Plan Sprint**: Use `planning/sprint-backlog.md` for next sprint preparation
5. **Track Dependencies**: Update `planning/dependency-map.md` for blockers

## Task Lifecycle

```
[Backlog] → [Sprint Planning] → [In Progress] → [Review] → [Done] → [Archive]
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓        ↓         ↓
[Priority Files] [Sprint Backlog] [Current Sprint] [Review] [Completed] [Archive]
```

## Key Features

- **Priority-Based Organization**: P0 (Critical) through P3 (Low) classification
- **Sprint Planning**: Weekly/bi-weekly sprint management
- **Dependency Tracking**: Visual dependency mapping and blocker identification
- **Capacity Planning**: Story point estimation and velocity tracking
- **Status Workflows**: Clear state transitions with defined criteria
- **Template System**: Standardized task formats for consistency
- **Integration Ready**: Works with existing development workflow and tools

## Operational Guidelines

- **Daily Standups**: Review `active/current-sprint.md`
- **Weekly Grooming**: Update priority files and dependency map
- **Sprint Planning**: Use capacity tracking for realistic sprint sizing
- **Retrospectives**: Archive completed sprints with lessons learned

This system is designed to scale with the Learning Platform project while maintaining the flexibility and organization principles established in the existing memory bank structure.
