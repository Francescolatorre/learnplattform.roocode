# TASK-002: Implement Progress Tracking Frontend Components

## Status: DONE

## Description
Enhance the existing React frontend with user interface components to display and interact with user progress data. Building on the existing Material UI framework and React Query for data fetching, these components will allow students to track their progress through courses and enable instructors to monitor student engagement and performance.

## Requirements

### Student Dashboard Components

1. **Course Progress Overview**
   - Visual progress indicators for each enrolled course
   - Completion percentage and status indicators using Material UI LinearProgress components
   - Quick navigation to continue where left off

2. **Course Detail View**
   - Module/section completion tracking
   - Task-by-task progress indicators
   - Time spent statistics
   - Achievement badges/milestones

3. **Quiz History Components**
   - List of attempted quizzes with scores
   - Quiz detail view showing correct/incorrect answers
   - Performance trends over time using Chart.js/react-chartjs-2
   - Option to retake quizzes (respecting max_attempts constraint)

### Instructor Dashboard Components

1. **Class Progress Overview**
   - Aggregated progress metrics across all students
   - Identification of at-risk students
   - Cohort performance comparison

2. **Student Detail View**
   - Individual student progress details
   - Time spent on different activities
   - Quiz performance breakdown
   - Engagement metrics

3. **Content Effectiveness Analysis**
   - Identify challenging quiz questions
   - Track time spent on learning tasks
   - Highlight content that may need revision

### Technical Requirements

1. **State Management and Data Fetching**
   - Use React Query (already installed) for data fetching and caching
   - Utilize the existing `progressService.ts` for API calls
   - Ensure proper loading and error states using Material UI components

2. **Component Structure**
   - Extend the existing `ProgressTrackingUI.tsx` component with additional functionality
   - Add missing components referenced in `ProgressTrackingUI.tsx` like `ModuleProgressView`
   - Integrate with existing layout in `MainLayout.tsx`

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Use react-chartjs-2 (already installed) for charts and visualizations
   - Implement Doughnut and Bar charts as shown in `ProgressTrackingUI.tsx`
   - Style visualizations to match the application theme

4. **TypeScript Integration**
   - Utilize the existing types in `progressTypes.ts` for all components
   - Add any missing types needed for new components
   - Ensure strict type safety

## Implementation Details

The following components have been implemented:

1. **ModuleProgressView**: Displays detailed progress for each module, including completion percentage, tasks completed, and average scores.

2. **PerformanceAnalysisView**: Shows performance metrics and visualizations for quiz scores, time spent, and skill proficiency.

3. **ActivityHistoryView**: Displays a timeline of student activities, including submissions, grades received, and achievements earned.

4. **TaskDetailsView**: Provides detailed information about tasks, including status, scores, attempts, and due dates.

5. **InstructorProgressDashboard**: Instructor-specific dashboard with class overview, student details, and content effectiveness analysis.

Additionally, the following supporting files were created or updated:

1. **progressTypes.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for progress tracking data structures.

2. **courseTypes.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for course structure data.

3. **progressService.ts**: Service functions for fetching and updating progress data.

4. **ProgressTrackingUI.tsx**: Updated to include the new components and instructor view toggle.

## Validation Criteria

1. ✅ All required components render correctly and display accurate data
2. ✅ Components successfully fetch and update data via React Query
3. ✅ UI is responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
4. ✅ Visual indicators clearly communicate progress status
5. ✅ Loading states and error handling work as expected using Material UI
6. ✅ User can navigate effectively between different progress views
7. ✅ All components meet accessibility standards
8. ✅ Charts correctly visualize progress data using Chart.js

## Dependencies

1. TASK-001: Implement User Progress Tracking Models (backend) - DONE
2. TASK-003: Implement Progress Tracking API Endpoints - DONE
3. Existing frontend navigation and layout components
4. Authentication system (AuthContext)

## Estimated Effort
Large (2-3 days)

## Completion Notes
All required components have been implemented according to the specifications. The implementation includes both student-facing components for tracking individual progress and instructor-facing components for monitoring class performance and content effectiveness. The components are fully integrated with the existing frontend architecture and utilize React Query for data fetching and caching.

The instructor view can be toggled on/off when the user has instructor privileges, providing a seamless experience for instructors who need to switch between their own progress and their students' progress.

All components are responsive and work well on different screen sizes. Visual indicators such as progress bars, charts, and status chips clearly communicate progress status to users. Loading states and error handling are implemented using Material UI components for a consistent user experience.
