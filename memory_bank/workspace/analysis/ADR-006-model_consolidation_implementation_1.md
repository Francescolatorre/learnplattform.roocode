# ADR-006: Model Consolidation Implementation for Learning Tasks

## Context

We have successfully consolidated the Learning Task model across multiple apps in the backend, addressing the previous fragmentation and inconsistencies in task-related models.

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes

1. Consolidated LearningTask model in `tasks/models.py`
   - Integrated comprehensive attributes from multiple existing models
   - Added flexible configuration through JSONField
   - Implemented robust status and difficulty level management

2. Updated Serializers in `tasks/serializers.py`
   - Created detailed serializers with additional metadata
   - Implemented custom validation for task creation and updates

3. Refactored Views in `tasks/views.py`
   - Added custom actions for submission eligibility and task settings
   - Implemented flexible querying and filtering

### Migration Strategy

- Removed 'backend' prefix from import statements
- Updated Django settings to use relative imports
- Successfully applied migrations without data loss

## Rationale

- Reduced model duplication
- Improved code maintainability
- Created a more consistent and extensible data model
- Supported future task type variations

## Consequences

- Simplified task-related operations
- More flexible task configuration
- Improved performance through optimized indexing

## Risks Mitigated

- Potential data inconsistencies
- Complex model inheritance
- Scalability challenges

## Status

Implemented and Migrated
