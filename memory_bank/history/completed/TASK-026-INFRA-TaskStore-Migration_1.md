# Task: TaskStore Migration to ILearningTask Model

## Task Metadata
- **Task-ID:** TASK-026
- **Type:** INFRA
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** High
- **Last Updated:** 2025-06-20
- **Estimated Hours:** 16
- **Hours Spent:** 0
- **Remaining Hours:** 16
- **Total Subtasks:** 4
- **Active Subtasks:** 0
- **Completion:** 0%

## Business Context
The current implementation of `taskStore.ts` uses a simplified task model that doesn't align with the comprehensive `ILearningTask` interface defined in `Task.ts`. This misalignment limits the application's ability to manage tasks effectively and creates potential inconsistencies between frontend and backend data models. The migration is essential for ensuring type consistency across the application and enabling more robust task management capabilities.

## Requirements
### Core Requirements
1. Update the taskStore to use the ILearningTask interface from Task.ts
2. Expand the store's state and actions to handle the more complex task model
3. Add API integration for synchronizing with the backend
4. Maintain backward compatibility with existing components during transition
5. Add comprehensive type safety throughout the implementation
6. Implement selectors for derived state (filtered tasks, tasks by course, etc.)
7. Add proper error handling and loading states
8. Ensure immutable update patterns are consistently applied

### State Structure
- Tasks collection (ILearningTask[])
- Task progress tracking (Record<string, ITaskProgress>)
- Loading states (boolean flags for various operations)
- Error states (for API operations)

### Migration Strategy
- Incremental approach to maintain compatibility
- Adapter functions to convert between old and new formats if needed
- Comprehensive testing at each stage

## Implementation
### Subtask-1: Update Task Interface and State Structure
- **ID:** TASK-026-SUB-001
- **Status:** DRAFT
- **Estimated Hours:** 3
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Description:** Replace the simplified Task interface with ILearningTask and update the state structure to include additional properties like loading states, error handling, and task progress tracking.
- **Validation:** Type checking passes, state structure includes all required properties.

### Subtask-2: Implement Enhanced Actions
- **ID:** TASK-026-SUB-002
- **Status:** DRAFT
- **Estimated Hours:** 5
- **Dependencies:** TASK-026-SUB-001
- **Description:** Expand the store actions to handle the more complex task model, including CRUD operations, status management, and filtering/sorting functions.
- **Validation:** All actions work correctly with the new state structure, immutable update patterns are consistently applied.

### Subtask-3: Add API Integration
- **ID:** TASK-026-SUB-003
- **Status:** DRAFT
- **Estimated Hours:** 4
- **Dependencies:** TASK-026-SUB-002
- **Description:** Implement API integration for synchronizing tasks with the backend, including fetching tasks, creating/updating/deleting tasks, and handling task progress.
- **Validation:** API calls work correctly, data is properly synchronized between frontend and backend.

### Subtask-4: Testing and Documentation
- **ID:** TASK-026-SUB-004
- **Status:** DRAFT
- **Estimated Hours:** 4
- **Dependencies:** TASK-026-SUB-003
- **Description:** Write comprehensive tests for the refactored store and update documentation to reflect the new implementation.
- **Validation:** All tests pass, documentation is complete and accurate.

## Documentation
### Related Work
- Task.ts interface definitions
- Current taskStore.ts implementation
- Components that consume the taskStore

### Validation Criteria
1. All components using taskStore continue to function correctly
2. Type safety is maintained throughout the codebase
3. No runtime errors related to task properties
4. Task CRUD operations work correctly with the backend API
5. Task filtering and sorting functions work as expected
6. Loading and error states are properly handled in the UI
7. Unit tests pass for all store functions
8. Integration tests pass for components using the store

## Risk Assessment
### Technical Risks
- Breaking changes to components that rely on the current taskStore implementation
- Type incompatibilities between the simplified model and the comprehensive model
- Performance impact of the more complex state structure
- Increased complexity in state management logic
- Potential race conditions with API integration

### Mitigation Strategies
- Incremental migration approach
- Comprehensive testing at each stage
- Thorough documentation updates
- Close monitoring of performance metrics

## Progress Tracking
### Status Roll-up Rules
1. Task is considered DONE when:
   - All subtasks are marked as DONE
   - All validation criteria are met
   - Required documentation is complete

2. Progress Calculation:
   - Completion % = (Completed Subtasks / Total Subtasks) * 100
   - Subtask weights can be adjusted in metadata if needed

### Current Progress
- Subtask 1: 0%
- Subtask 2: 0%
- Subtask 3: 0%
- Subtask 4: 0%
- Overall: 0%

## Review Checklist
- [ ] All subtasks completed
- [ ] Type safety verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Backward compatibility verified
- [ ] API integration tested
- [ ] Error handling validated

## Notes
This refactoring is essential for ensuring type consistency across the application and enabling more robust task management capabilities. The current simplified model is inadequate for the complex requirements of the learning platform, and this migration will align the frontend state management with the backend data model.
