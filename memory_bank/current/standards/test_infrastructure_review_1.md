# Test Infrastructure Review

## Overview
Review of TEST-001 implementation and its architectural implications.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Testing Framework Structure
- Pytest as the primary test runner
- Django test integration via pytest-django
- Factory Boy for test data generation
- Coverage reporting with pytest-cov

### 2. Configuration Approach
- Centralized pytest configuration in pytest.ini
- Separate settings module for tests (settings_test.py)
- Structured coverage configuration in .coveragerc

### 3. Test Discovery
- Standardized test file patterns:
  - tests.py
  - test_*.py
  - *_tests.py
- Ensures consistent test organization across the project

### 4. Coverage Strategy
- Full source coverage tracking
- Strategic exclusions:
  - Migrations
  - Test files
  - Configuration files
  - Infrastructure code
- HTML report generation for visibility

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies
- All core testing packages installed and verified
- Version compatibility confirmed
- Temporary workaround for psycopg2-binary on Windows

### Integration Points
- Django settings module properly configured
- Test database settings defined
- Coverage reporting integrated with pytest

## Next Steps
1. Proceed with TEST-002 for base test configuration
2. Consider addressing psycopg2-binary installation issues
3. Plan for test data management strategy

## Recommendations
1. Document standard test patterns for the team
2. Consider setting up CI/CD integration
3. Establish coverage thresholds
4. Create test writing guidelines
