## Business Context

The ability to edit and delete tasks is critical for maintaining accurate and up-to-date task records. This functionality ensures that users can manage tasks effectively while adhering to permission constraints and providing a seamless user experience.

## Requirements

### User Stories

```markdown
As an authorized user,
I want to edit and delete tasks,
so that I can manage task records accurately and efficiently.
```

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Only authorized users can edit or delete tasks.
2. The edit form pre-fills existing task data and captures all modifications.
3. The deletion process includes a confirmation modal and supports undo functionality.
4. Permissions are strictly enforced with clear visual indicators.
5. The user interface provides clear feedback for all actions.

### Technical Requirements

- Use React with TypeScript.
- Implement state management (e.g., Redux or Context API).
- Create reusable modal components.
- Support internationalization.
- Integrate with the backend API.
- Implement comprehensive error handling.
- Ensure accessibility compliance.

---

## Implementation

### Technical Approach

- Develop a task editing interface with pre-filled data and version history tracking.
- Implement a deletion mechanism with soft delete, confirmation modal, and undo capability.
- Enforce role-based access control for edit and delete actions.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and ensure responsive design.

### Dependencies

- TASK-UI-002: UI Framework Enhancements
- TASK-EDIT-001: Backend API for Task Editing and Deletion

### Test Strategy

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test individual components (e.g., edit form, confirmation modal).
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Verify end-to-end functionality for editing and deleting tasks.
  - Test role-based access control and error handling.

### API Documentation

```typescript
import { TTaskStatus } from '@/types/Task';

interface Task {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: TTaskStatus;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
}

interface EditTaskPayload {
  id: number;
  title?: string;
  description?: string;
  status?: TTaskStatus;
}

interface DeleteTaskPayload {
  id: number;
  softDelete: boolean;
}
```

### Usage Examples

```typescript
const task: Task = {
  id: 101,
  title: 'Task Editing and Deletion',
  description: 'Develop an interface for editing and deleting tasks.',
  status: 'not_started',
  createdBy: 'admin',
  createdAt: '2025-06-01T12:00:00Z',
  updatedAt: '2025-06-15T12:00:00Z',
};

// Edit task
editTask({ id: task.id, title: 'Updated Title' });

// Delete task
deleteTask({ id: task.id, softDelete: true });
```

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

- Complex permission logic may introduce bugs.
  - **Impact:** High
  - **Mitigation:** Thorough testing and code reviews.

- Handling concurrent edits could lead to data inconsistencies.
  - **Impact:** Medium
  - **Mitigation:** Implement optimistic UI updates and conflict resolution.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure role-based access control is strictly enforced.
- Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
