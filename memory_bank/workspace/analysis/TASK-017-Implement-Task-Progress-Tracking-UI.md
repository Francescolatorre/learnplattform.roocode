## Task Metadata

- **Task-ID:** TASK-017
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Assigned To:** Architect
- **Started At:** 2025-02-26 21:28:31
- **Estimated Completion:** 2025-05-20
- **Dependencies:**
  - [TASK-PROGRESS-001](../tasks/TASK-PROGRESS-001.md),
  - [TASK-UI-004](../tasks/TASK-UI-004.md)
- **Story Points:** 6

## Description

Implement a comprehensive user interface for tracking student progress across learning tasks. This interface will provide students and instructors with visual representations of progress, completion rates, and performance metrics to support learning goals and identify areas for improvement.

## Business Context

Progress tracking is a critical component of effective learning experiences. It provides students with a sense of accomplishment, helps them identify areas for improvement, and motivates continued engagement. For instructors, progress tracking offers insights into student performance, enabling targeted interventions and curriculum adjustments. This feature directly supports educational outcomes by making learning progress visible and actionable.

## Technical Context

- **System Architecture:** React frontend with TypeScript
- **Related Components:**
  - Progress tracking system (from TASK-PROGRESS-001)
  - Task submission interface (from TASK-UI-004)
  - Course navigation components
  - User authentication system
- **Technical Constraints:**
  - Must integrate with existing task and submission data models
  - Must be responsive for mobile and desktop use
  - Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
  - Must support real-time updates when possible

## Requirements

### Inputs

- Student task submission data
- Task completion status
- Grading and feedback information
- Course structure and module organization
- Learning objectives and competencies

### Outputs

- Visual progress indicators
- Completion statistics
- Performance metrics
- Achievement notifications
- Personalized recommendations

### Functional Requirements

1. Student Dashboard
   - Overall course progress visualization
   - Module and section completion rates
   - Recent activity timeline
   - Upcoming deadlines and priorities
   - Performance trends and statistics
   - [x] Completed

2. Detailed Progress Views
   - Task-level completion status
   - Grade distribution and comparisons
   - Time spent on different task types
   - Strength and weakness identification
   - Learning objective achievement tracking
   - [x] Completed

3. Achievement System
   - Milestone recognition
   - Competency badges or certificates
   - Progress-based encouragement
   - Personalized goal setting
   - Streak and consistency tracking
   - [ ] Not Started

4. Instructor Views
   - Class-wide progress overview
   - Individual student progress details
   - Comparative performance analytics
   - Intervention recommendation tools
   - Export and reporting capabilities
   - [x] Completed

### Implementation Details

- The progress dashboard component has been implemented, which includes:
  - Fetching student progress data and course structure.
  - Displaying overall completion percentage.
  - Visualizing completion by module and performance by task type.
  - Preparing upcoming tasks for display.

### Required Libraries and Versions

- React 18.0+
- TypeScript 4.9+
- React Router 6.8+
- Redux Toolkit 1.9+ or React Query 4.0+ for state management
- Material UI 5.11+ for UI components
- Chart.js 4.0+ or D3.js 7.0+ for data visualization
- date-fns 2.29+ for date handling
- socket.io-client 4.5+ for real-time updates (optional)

### Edge Cases and Challenges

1. **No Progress Data**: Handle cases where students have not started any tasks
2. **Partial Course Completion**: Accurately represent progress when course is partially completed
3. **Instructor View Switching**: Support seamless switching between different student views
4. **Data Discrepancies**: Handle inconsistencies between task data and progress tracking
5. **Course Structure Changes**: Adapt progress visualization when course structure changes

## Estimated Effort

- Dashboard Implementation: 2 story points
- Module Progress View: 1 story point
- Performance Analysis View: 2 story points
- Activity History View: 1 story point
- Total: 6 story points

## Potential Risks

- Data visualization performance issues
- Complexity of real-time updates
- Accessibility challenges with interactive charts
- Browser compatibility issues with advanced visualizations
- Data synchronization issues between client and server
