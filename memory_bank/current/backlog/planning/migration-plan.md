**Responsible**: Requirements Engineering Agent + Tech Lead

#### Step 1.1: Inventory Completion
- [ ] Complete scan of all memory_bank directories
- [ ] Extract task metadata (ID, title, description, current status)
- [ ] Identify duplicates and consolidation opportunities
- [ ] Document task relationships and dependencies

#### Step 1.2: Priority Assessment
For each task, evaluate:
- [ ] **User Impact**: How many users affected and severity of impact
- [ ] **Business Value**: Alignment with Q1 2025 strategic objectives
- [ ] **Technical Risk**: Complexity and architectural impact
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Prerequisite tasks and blocking relationships
- [ ] **Effort Estimation**: Story points using established scale

#### Step 1.3: Quality Gate Application
Apply Definition of Ready criteria to determine if tasks are ready for new system:
- [ ] Requirements clearly defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria documented
- [ ] Technical approach understood
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Effort estimated

### Phase 2: Task Restructuring and Enhancement
**Duration**: 2 days
**Responsible**: Requirements Engineering Agent

#### Step 2.1: Template Application
For each task meeting quality gates:
- [ ] Convert to appropriate template (task/epic/defect/spike)
- [ ] Enhance with Learning Platform specific context
- [ ] Add modern service migration alignment (TASK-012)
- [ ] Include user role impact assessment
- [ ] Define specific acceptance criteria

#### Step 2.2: Missing Information Research
For tasks lacking complete information:
- [ ] Research original requirements from related ADRs
- [ ] Infer user stories from existing implementation
- [ ] Estimate effort based on similar completed tasks
- [ ] Document assumptions and validation needed

#### Step 2.3: Dependency Mapping
- [ ] Create visual dependency map

- [ ] Highlight potential blockers and risks
- [ ] Plan parallel work streams where possible

### Phase 3: Backlog Population
**Duration**: 1 day
**Responsible**: Requirements Engineering Agent + Product Owner

#### Step 3.1: Priority File Population
- [ ] Add P1 tasks to `active/p1-high.md`
- [ ] Add P2 tasks to `active/p2-medium.md`
- [ ] Add P3 tasks to `active/p3-low.md`
- [ ] Ensure P0 remains empty (emergency use only)

#### Step 3.2: Planning Document Updates
- [ ] Update `planning/product-backlog.md` with all migrated tasks
- [ ] Create initial `planning/dependency-map.md`
- [ ] Establish baseline for `planning/capacity-tracking.md`
- [ ] Plan next sprint in `planning/sprint-backlog.md`

#### Step 3.3: Current Sprint Integration
- [ ] Move in-progress tasks to `active/current-sprint.md`
- [ ] Update task status in workflow system
- [ ] Notify team members of new task tracking locations
- [ ] Establish daily standup integration with new system

### Phase 4: Validation and Rollout
**Duration**: 1 day
**Responsible**: Full Team

#### Step 4.1: Team Review

- [ ] Gather feedback and make adjustments

#### Step 4.2: Process Training
- [ ] Train team on new templates and workflow
- [ ] Establish new daily/weekly routines
- [ ] Define roles and responsibilities for backlog maintenance
- [ ] Create quick reference guides for common operations

#### Step 4.3: Legacy System Transition

## Quality Assurance for Migration

### Migration Validation Checklist
For each migrated task:
- [ ] **Completeness**: All essential information migrated
- [ ] **Accuracy**: Priority and effort estimates reasonable
- [ ] **Consistency**: Follows template and naming conventions
- [ ] **Traceability**: Links to original task documentation
- [ ] **Dependencies**: All relationships properly mapped

### Post-Migration Metrics
Track these metrics for 4 weeks post-migration:
- **Team Adoption**: Percentage of team using new system daily
- **Process Efficiency**: Time spent on task management activities
- **Clarity**: Number of questions/clarifications needed about tasks
- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint (baseline vs. new system)

## Risk Mitigation

### Migration Risks
1. **Information Loss**: Critical details lost during migration
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain links to original task files
2. **Priority Misalignment**: Incorrect priority assignments
   - **Mitigation**: Weekly priority review meetings for first month
3. **Team Confusion**: Learning curve for new system
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training and documentation
4. **Process Overhead**: New system creates more work than value
   - **Mitigation**: Streamline processes based on team feedback

### Rollback Plan
If migration proves problematic:
1. **Week 1**: Address issues and continue with new system
2. **Week 2**: Consider hybrid approach using both systems
3. **Week 3**: Full rollback to old system if necessary
4. **Week 4**: Post-mortem and lessons learned

## Success Criteria

### Migration Success
- [ ] All active tasks migrated to new system
- [ ] Team comfortable with new workflow within 2 weeks
- [ ] No critical information lost during migration
- [ ] Sprint planning improved with new structure

### Long-term Success
- [ ] Improved task visibility and prioritization
- [ ] Faster decision-making on task priorities
- [ ] Better alignment between development work and business goals
- [ ] Increased team satisfaction with task management process
