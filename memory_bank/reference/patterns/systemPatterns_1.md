# System Patterns and Architecture Decisions

This document outlines the key architectural patterns and decisions made in the Course Management System.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Architectural Issue: Direct API Calls in LoginForm

**Description:**

The `LoginForm` component in `frontend/src/features/auth/LoginForm.tsx` is directly calling the `login` function from the API service (`../../services/api`) instead of using the `login` function provided by the `AuthContext`.

**Consequences:**

*   **Lack of Separation of Concerns:** The `LoginForm` is responsible for both UI logic and authentication state management, violating the single responsibility principle.
*   **Inconsistent Authentication Handling:** Authentication logic is duplicated in multiple places, leading to potential inconsistencies and making it harder to maintain and test.
*   **Tight Coupling:** The `LoginForm` is tightly coupled to the API service, making it harder to switch to a different authentication mechanism in the future.

**Proposed Solution:**

1.  **Modify `LoginForm.tsx`:**
    *   Import the `useAuth` hook from `AuthContext.tsx`.
    *   Use the `login` function from the `useAuth` hook instead of the one from `../../services/api`.
2.  **Centralize Authentication Logic:** Ensure that all authentication-related logic is handled within the `AuthContext`.

This will ensure that the `LoginForm` is only responsible for handling the UI and form submission, while the `AuthContext` is responsible for managing the authentication state and providing the `login` function.

## Course Versioning

### Architectural Issue: Managing Multiple Versions of Courses

**Description:**

The Learning Platform needs to manage multiple versions of courses to allow for updates and revisions without disrupting the ongoing courses.

**Consequences:**

* **Complex Data Management:** Managing multiple versions of the same course can lead to complex data structures and require careful handling to ensure data integrity.
* **Increased Storage Requirements:** Each version of a course might require separate storage, increasing the overall data storage requirements.
* **Difficulty in Tracking Changes:** It can be challenging to track changes across different versions and ensure that all relevant updates are accurately reflected.

**Proposed Solution:**

1. **Implement a Version Control System:**
   * Use a version control system similar to software versioning systems like Git. This system will handle different versions of courses and allow easy reversion to previous versions if needed.
2. **Database Schema Design:**
   * Design the database schema to include a version number for each course. Each version will store a snapshot of the course content, metadata, and associated learning tasks.
3. **UI/UX Considerations:**
   * Ensure that the user interface allows instructors to easily switch between different versions, view version histories, and manage updates.

This approach will streamline the management of course versions, reduce the complexity of data handling, and improve the overall user experience by providing clear visibility and control over course content versions.
