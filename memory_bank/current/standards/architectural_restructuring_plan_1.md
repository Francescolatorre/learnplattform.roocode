# Architectural Restructuring Plan

## Current Architecture Analysis

### App Structure
- users: User management and authentication
- tasks: Core task definitions and base functionality
- assessment: Quiz and submission management
- learning: Course management and learning content
- core: Basic functionality and shared components

### Key Issues
1. Redundant imports and circular dependencies between apps
2. Business logic embedded in models
3. No dedicated service layer for complex operations
4. Inefficient database queries without proper optimization

## Proposed Architecture

### 1. Unified Core App Structure

#### core/
- models/
  - task.py (consolidated from tasks app)
  - course.py (moved from learning app)
  - assessment.py (moved from assessment app)
- services/
  - task_service.py
  - course_service.py
  - assessment_service.py
- interfaces/
  - base_service.py
  - repository.py
- repositories/
  - task_repository.py
  - course_repository.py
  - assessment_repository.py

### 2. Service Layer Implementation

Each service will:
- Implement business logic previously scattered in models
- Handle complex database queries with optimization
- Provide a clean interface for views
- Manage transactions and data integrity

Example Service Structure:
```python
class TaskService:
    def __init__(self, repository):
        self.repository = repository

    def get_course_tasks(self, course_id):
        return self.repository.get_tasks_by_course(
            course_id,
            select_related=['course'],
            prefetch_related=['submissions']
        )

    def submit_assessment(self, user_id, task_id, content):
        # Transaction handling
        # Validation logic
        # Submission creation
        pass
```

### 3. Repository Pattern

Repositories will:
- Abstract database operations
- Implement query optimization
- Handle select_related and prefetch_related
- Provide reusable query methods

Example Repository Structure:
```python
class TaskRepository:
    def get_tasks_by_course(self, course_id, select_related=None, prefetch_related=None):
        query = Task.objects
        
        if select_related:
            query = query.select_related(*select_related)
        
        if prefetch_related:
            query = query.prefetch_related(*prefetch_related)
            
        return query.filter(course_id=course_id)
```

### 4. Model Restructuring

1. Move all task-related models to core/models/task.py
2. Implement abstract base classes for common functionality
3. Use model managers for complex queries
4. Keep models focused on data structure, not business logic

### 5. Testing Strategy

1. Service Layer Tests
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for service interactions
   - Use Factory Boy for test data generation

2. Repository Tests
   - Test query optimization
   - Verify correct eager loading
   - Test complex queries

3. Model Tests
   - Basic model validation
   - Field constraints
   - Model relationships

## Implementation Steps

1. Create New Structure
   - Set up core app directory structure
   - Create service and repository base classes
   - Implement interfaces

2. Data Migration
   - Create migrations for model moves
   - Verify data integrity
   - Handle foreign key updates

3. Service Implementation
   - Move business logic to services
   - Implement optimized queries
   - Add transaction handling

4. Testing
   - Set up Factory Boy fixtures
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Verify query performance

5. View Updates
   - Refactor views to use services
   - Remove direct model access
   - Update API endpoints

## Performance Considerations

1. Query Optimization
   - Use select_related() for foreign keys
   - Use prefetch_related() for reverse relations
   - Implement query caching where appropriate

2. Transaction Management
   - Handle complex operations in transactions
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Ensure data consistency

## Migration Strategy

1. Incremental Implementation
   - Move one feature set at a time
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Run old and new code in parallel initially

2. Testing Requirements
   - Full test coverage for new services
   - Integration tests for critical paths
   - Performance testing for database queries

## Next Steps

1. Begin with core service layer implementation
2. Create initial repository implementations
3. Move one model group to new structure
4. Update corresponding views and tests
5. Validate and iterate on the changes
