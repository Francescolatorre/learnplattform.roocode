# PYTHONPATH and Model Discovery Investigation Summary

## Core Issue
Unexpected test discovery and potential model registration conflicts in Django/pytest environment

## Diagnostic Approach
Atomic, modular investigation using targeted microtasks to isolate and resolve configuration complexities

### Key Investigation Areas
1. **PYTHONPATH Configuration**
   - Precise mapping of current path resolution
   - Identifying potential conflict sources

2. **Model Registration Mechanism**
   - Verifying unique model definitions
   - Eliminating phantom registration issues

3. **Test Discovery Optimization**
   - Implementing strict path constraints
   - Ensuring predictable module collection

4. **Import Statement Standardization**
   - Normalizing import patterns
   - Removing relative import dependencies

## Proposed Solutions
- Microtask-driven diagnostic process
- Potential virtual environment restructuring
- Systematic import and path resolution refinement

## Potential Outcomes
- Improved test reliability
- Clearer module dependency management
- Reduced risk of unexpected import conflicts

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Execute PYTHONPATH diagnostic microtask
2. Verify model registration mechanism
3. Implement controlled test discovery
4. Standardize import statements

## Tracking
- Investigation Started: 2/14/2025
- Methodology: Atomic Microtask Diagnostic Approach
- Current Status: Strategic Framework and Documentation Complete

## Recommended Approach
Proceed step-by-step through the defined microtasks, documenting findings and validating each stage before progressing.
