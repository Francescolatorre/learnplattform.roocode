# Virtual Environment Restructuring Plan

## Current Configuration
- Virtual environment located: Inside project root
- Potential impact on PYTHONPATH resolution
- Possible interference with test discovery

## Proposed Restructuring Strategy

### Objective
Optimize virtual environment placement to minimize import and path resolution complexities

### Recommended Layout
```
learnplatfom2/
│
├── backend/           # Django project root
│   ├── ...
│
├── venv/              # Virtual environment at same level as backend
│   ├── bin/
│   ├── lib/
│   └── ...
│
└── requirements.txt
```

### Implementation Steps
1. Backup existing virtual environment
2. Create new virtual environment at project root
3. Reinstall project dependencies
4. Update development scripts and configuration files
5. Verify Python path and import behaviors

### Validation Criteria
- Consistent PYTHONPATH resolution
- Uninterrupted test discovery
- Maintained dependency isolation
- No changes to existing import statements

### Potential Benefits
- Simplified path management
- Reduced risk of unexpected import conflicts
- More standard Python project structure

## Risks and Mitigations
- Dependency reinstallation
- Potential environment configuration adjustments
- Minimal code changes required

## Next Actions
- Confirm current virtual environment configuration
- Prepare comprehensive backup
- Execute restructuring in controlled environment
