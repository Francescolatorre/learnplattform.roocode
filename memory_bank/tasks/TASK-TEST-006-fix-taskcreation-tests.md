# TASK-TEST-006: Fix TaskCreation Component Tests

## Task Metadata

- **Task-ID:** TASK-TEST-006
- **Status:** DRAFT
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Effort:** 5 story points

## Status: DRAFT

## Description

The TaskCreation component tests are currently limited due to issues with the ErrorNotifier context in the testing environment. The tests hang when trying to run with the real component due to context-related dependencies. A temporary workaround has been implemented by completely mocking the component and skipping most tests, but a proper solution is needed.

## Requirements

1. Diagnose and fix the issues related to the ErrorNotifier context in tests
2. Implement a reliable testing approach for components that use the useNotification hook
3. Re-enable and implement the skipped tests in TaskCreation.test.tsx
4. Ensure tests run consistently without hanging
5. Maintain the existing dependency injection approach established in the TaskCreation component

## Implementation Details

### Current State

- The TaskCreation component has been modified to accept a `notificationService` prop for dependency injection
- A simplified test file has been created that mocks the entire component to avoid context-related issues
- Most tests are currently skipped to prevent hanging

### Proposed Solution

1. Create a proper mock implementation for the ErrorNotifier context that works reliably in tests
2. Establish a pattern for testing components that rely on context providers
3. Create a reusable test utility that provides the required context providers
4. Update the TaskCreation.test.tsx to use this approach and implement all skipped tests
5. Document the approach for other developers to follow

### Technical Approach

```typescript
// Example of a possible test utility
export function renderWithProviders(ui: React.ReactElement) {
  return render(
    <ErrorProvider>
      {/* Add other providers as needed */}
      {ui}
    </ErrorProvider>
  );
}
```

## Validation Criteria

1. All TaskCreation component tests run without hanging
2. Test coverage includes:
   - Component rendering
   - Form validation
   - Input handling
   - Form submission
   - Error handling
3. Tests run consistently in CI/CD pipeline
4. The approach is documented for reuse in other component tests

## Dependencies

- ErrorProvider from `@components/ErrorNotifier/ErrorProvider`
- useNotification from `@components/ErrorNotifier/useErrorNotifier`
- TaskCreation component

## Potential Risks

- Changes to the ErrorNotifier implementation could affect multiple components
- Test environment differences between local and CI/CD systems
