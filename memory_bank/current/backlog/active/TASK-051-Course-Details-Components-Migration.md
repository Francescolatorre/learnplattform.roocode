## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a student/instructor viewing course details**
I want course information to load faster and more reliably
So that I can quickly access course content, tasks, and progress data without delays.

### Supporting User Stories

**As a student**
I want to view course details, learning tasks, and my progress
So that I can understand my course requirements and track completion.

**As an instructor**
I want to manage course details, view student progress, and edit course content
So that I can effectively administer my courses and support student learning.

**As a developer**
I want course components to use modern service patterns
So that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and performs efficiently.

## Architecture Impact

### Modern Service Integration
- **Primary Service**: `modernCourseService` (course data, CRUD operations)
- **Supporting Services**:
  - `modernLearningTaskService` (task management)
  - `modernProgressService` (student progress)
  - `modernEnrollmentService` (enrollment status)

### Component Architecture Changes
```typescript
// Before (Legacy Pattern)
import { fetchCourseDetails, updateCourse } from '@/services/resources/courseService';

// After (Modern Pattern)
import { modernCourseService } from '@/services/resources/modernCourseService';
const courseService = ServiceFactory.getInstance().getService(ModernCourseService);
```

### State Management Integration
- Leverage modern service error handling patterns
- Implement consistent loading state management
- Use modern caching strategies for performance

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks (Medium)
- **Complexity**: Multiple service integrations in single components
- **Data Flow**: Complex instructor vs student role-based rendering
- **Migration Scope**: 3 high-traffic components with different patterns

**Mitigation**:
- Follow established migration template from TASK-048/TASK-054
- Implement incremental migration with feature flags if needed
- Comprehensive testing at each integration step

### Business Risks (Low)
- **User Impact**: Critical course viewing functionality
- **Downtime**: Risk of regression during migration

**Mitigation**:
- Maintain 100% backward compatibility during migration
- Comprehensive testing before deployment
- Rollback plan with legacy service fallback

### Performance Risks (Low)
- **Loading Times**: Risk of slower initial load during integration
- **Memory Usage**: Multiple service instantiation

**Mitigation**:
- Modern service caching reduces overall load times
- Service factory ensures efficient service instantiation
- Performance benchmarking validates improvements

## Notes

This task represents a significant milestone in Phase 2B component migration, affecting some of the highest-traffic components in the application. Success here establishes patterns for remaining component migrations and delivers measurable performance improvements to core user workflows.

The migration follows established patterns from TASK-048 (TaskCreation) and TASK-054 (NavigationBar) while scaling to more complex multi-service integrations that will inform future migration work.
