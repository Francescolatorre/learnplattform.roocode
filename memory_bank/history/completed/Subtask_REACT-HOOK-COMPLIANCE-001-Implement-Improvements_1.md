**Parent Task:** REACT-HOOK-COMPLIANCE-001

**Status:** DONE

## Progress Update

- Refactoring of `useTaskCreation` hook to accept dynamic `courseId` has been completed.
- Enhancements to error handling in `learningTaskService` methods have been implemented.
- Console.debug statements have been removed or replaced with a configurable logging utility.
- Documentation has been updated to reflect changes in hooks and service error handling.
- Unit and integration test coverage for hooks and service modules has been verified and improved.

## Description

Implement the open checkpoints identified during the code review of the refactored React hooks and service modules. This includes improving flexibility, error handling, logging, documentation, and test coverage.

## Implementation Checklist

- [x] Refactor `useTaskCreation` hook to accept dynamic `courseId` instead of hardcoded value.
- [x] Enhance error handling in `learningTaskService` methods with custom error classes or centralized logging.
- [x] Remove or replace `console.debug` statements with a configurable logging utility.
- [x] Update documentation to reflect changes in hooks and service error handling.
- [x] Verify and improve unit and integration test coverage for hooks and service modules.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The `useTaskCreation` hook no longer uses hardcoded courseId and supports dynamic input or context.
- Service methods have improved error handling and logging mechanisms.
- No `console.debug` statements remain; logging is configurable.
- Documentation is updated to reflect all changes.
- Unit and integration tests pass and cover the updated code.

## Notes

This subtask is critical to ensure robustness, maintainability, and compliance with architectural standards following the initial refactoring and review.
