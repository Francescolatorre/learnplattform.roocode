# Task Prioritization Framework

## Priority Levels and Criteria

### P0 - Critical (Immediate Action Required)
**Timeframe**: Fix within 24-48 hours
**Examples**: Production bugs, security vulnerabilities, system outages

**Criteria**:
- System is broken or unusable
- Security vulnerability exposed
- Data integrity at risk
- Prevents other team members from working
- Regulatory compliance issue

**Learning Platform Specific**:
- Authentication system failures
- Data loss in student submissions
- Course enrollment blocking all users
- API endpoints returning 500 errors consistently
- Database corruption or migration failures

### P1 - High Priority (Current Sprint)
**Timeframe**: Complete within current sprint (1-2 weeks)
**Examples**: Key features, performance issues, user-blocking bugs

**Criteria**:
- Core functionality needed for upcoming release
- Significant user experience degradation
- Performance issues affecting >20% of users
- Blocking other high-priority work
- Customer-facing feature with committed deadline

**Learning Platform Specific**:
- Task submission/grading workflow issues
- Course creation/editing problems
- Student progress tracking failures
- Modern service migration (Phase 2 TASK-012)
- Critical UI/UX improvements for instructor workflows

### P2 - Medium Priority (Next 1-2 Sprints)
**Timeframe**: Complete within 2-4 weeks
**Examples**: Feature enhancements, minor bugs, performance improvements

**Criteria**:
- Improves user experience but not blocking
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Technical debt reduction
- Feature requests from active users
- Documentation and testing improvements

**Learning Platform Specific**:
- Advanced grading features
- Student dashboard enhancements
- Instructor analytics and reporting
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- API documentation and SDK development
- Code quality and testing coverage improvements

### P3 - Low Priority (Backlog)
**Timeframe**: Complete when capacity allows (1+ months)
**Examples**: Nice-to-have features, minor UX improvements, research spikes

**Criteria**:
- Enhancement requests with unclear ROI
- Experimental features for future consideration
- Minor UI polish and cosmetic improvements
- Research and proof-of-concept work
- Long-term strategic initiatives

**Learning Platform Specific**:
- AI-powered learning recommendations
- Advanced analytics and machine learning features
- Gamification elements
- Third-party integrations (LTI, SCORM)
- Advanced personalization features
- Mobile app development

## Priority Assignment Guidelines

### Impact vs Effort Matrix
```
High Impact, Low Effort    → P1 (Quick Wins)
High Impact, High Effort   → P1-P2 (Major Features)
Low Impact, Low Effort     → P2-P3 (Easy Improvements)
Low Impact, High Effort    → P3 (Question if needed)
```

### Stakeholder Influence
- **Students**: Learning experience, submission workflow, progress tracking
- **Instructors**: Course management, grading efficiency, analytics
- **Administrators**: System reliability, security, scalability
- **Developers**: Technical debt, development efficiency, maintainability

### Technical Considerations
- **Architecture Alignment**: Tasks supporting modern service migration get +1 priority
- **Security**: Any security-related task gets minimum P1 priority
- **Performance**: Issues affecting >100 users get P1, <100 users get P2
- **Dependencies**: Blocking tasks for P0/P1 items automatically become P1

## Prioritization Process

### Weekly Priority Review
1. **Review P0 items**: Should be empty except for genuine emergencies
2. **Validate P1 items**: Ensure alignment with sprint goals and capacity
3. **Rebalance P2/P3**: Move items based on new information and changing priorities
4. **Dependency check**: Ensure prerequisite tasks are appropriately prioritized

### Sprint Planning Priority
1. Fill sprint with P0 items first (should be minimal)
2. Add P1 items based on sprint capacity
3. Include P2 items if sprint has remaining capacity
4. Use P3 items as stretch goals or research time

### Emergency Re-prioritization
- New P0 items can displace current sprint work
- P1 items may be moved to next sprint to accommodate P0
- Document rationale for any mid-sprint priority changes
- Communicate impact to stakeholders immediately

## Priority Escalation

### When to Escalate
- P2 item becomes blocking for P1 work
- New information changes impact assessment
- External dependencies affect timeline
- Resource constraints prevent P1 completion

### Escalation Process
1. Document rationale for priority change
2. Assess impact on current sprint commitments
3. Communicate with affected stakeholders
4. Update dependency map and capacity planning
5. Move tasks between priority files with clear audit trail

## Learning Platform Specific Priority Considerations

### TypeScript Service Migration (TASK-012 Phase 2)
- High-traffic components get P1 priority
- Supporting infrastructure gets P2 priority
- Performance monitoring and optimization gets P1-P2 based on impact

### User Journey Priorities
- **Student Journey**: Task submission → progress tracking → feedback receipt
- **Instructor Journey**: Course creation → task management → grading workflow
- **System Journey**: Authentication → authorization → data integrity

### Technical Debt Priorities
- Security vulnerabilities: P0-P1
- Performance issues: P1-P2 based on user impact
- Code quality improvements: P2-P3
- Documentation gaps: P2-P3
- Test coverage: P2 for critical paths, P3 for edge cases

This prioritization framework ensures that the Learning Platform development team focuses on the most impactful work while maintaining system reliability and user experience.
