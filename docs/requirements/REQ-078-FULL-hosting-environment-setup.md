## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Platform Vendor Lock-in**
   - **Risk**: Dependency on specific hosting platforms
   - **Mitigation**: Use Docker containers for portability, document migration procedures

2. **Database Performance**
   - **Risk**: Neon PostgreSQL performance under load
   - **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring, connection pooling, query optimization

3. **Environment Configuration Drift**
   - **Risk**: Inconsistencies between environments
   - **Mitigation**: Infrastructure as Code, automated configuration validation

4. **Cost Management**
   - **Risk**: Unexpected hosting costs from auto-scaling
   - **Mitigation**: Set up billing alerts, usage monitoring, cost optimization

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **Deployment Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Complex monorepo deployment coordination
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, staged rollouts, rollback procedures

2. **Third-party Service Integration**
   - **Risk**: External service dependencies and API limits
   - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, circuit breakers, fallback mechanisms

## Quality Gates and Testing

### Pre-deployment Quality Gates

1. **Code Quality**: ESLint, TypeScript check, Django flake8/black
2. **Testing**: Unit tests (>80% coverage), integration tests, E2E tests
3. **Security**: Dependency vulnerability scanning, secrets detection
4. **Performance**: Bundle size limits, API response time benchmarks

### Post-deployment Validation

1. **Health Checks**: Automated health endpoint validation
2. **Smoke Tests**: Critical user journey validation
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Response time and error rate tracking
4. **User Acceptance**: Stakeholder validation for staging deployments
