# Active Context

## Current Phase

- **Phase**: Infrastructure Stabilization & Security Hardening
- **Focus**: Pipeline Optimization & Quality Assurance
- **Last Updated**: 2025-09-08

## Recent Achievements (Last 24 Hours)

âœ… **Pipeline Optimization**: Fixed E2E timeout issues, achieved 3/4 green pipelines
âœ… **Security Setup**: Created TASK-043 for GitHub Code Scanning remediation
âœ… **Performance**: E2E tests improved from 30+ min â†’ 19 min runtime
âœ… **Configuration**: Fixed authentication flows and port mismatches

## CRITICAL TASKS (Top 6 - Urgent Bug Added)

### ðŸš¨ URGENT - NEW CRITICAL BUG
1. **TASK-045-DEFECT-Student-Task-View-Navigation** [OPEN - CRITICAL]
   - **DISCOVERED**: During TASK-042 testing (2025-09-09)
   - **IMPACT**: Students cannot view task details - redirected to profile page instead
   - **USER JOURNEY BROKEN**: Students enrolled in courses cannot access assignments
   - **ACTION REQUIRED**: Immediate investigation and fix
   - Estimated: 4-6 hours

### ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
2. **TASK-043-SECURITY-GitHub-Code-Scanning-Remediation** [BACKLOG - High Priority]
   - Address all security findings from GitHub code scanning
   - Estimated: 8-12 hours
   
3. **TASK-044-E2E-Test-Pipeline-Stabilization** [REQUIRES REFINEMENT]
   - Fix E2E test reliability for local and CI environments
   - Status: Awaiting technical deep-dive session

### RECENTLY COMPLETED
4. **TASK-042-UI-Task-Deletion** [COMPLETED âœ…]
   - Instructor task deletion functionality with comprehensive role-based access control
   - Status: Pull Request #30 created and ready for review
   - Implementation: Complete with audit logging, progress protection, and UI/UX polish
   
5. **TASK-041-DEFECT-Cannot-create-task** [COMPLETED âœ…]
   - Critical bug fix for task creation flow - Fully resolved

### MAINTENANCE PRIORITY
6. **TASK-012-INFRA-TypeScript-Services-Standard** [IN PROGRESS]
   - Enforce TypeScript service standardization

## Current Blockers

- **E2E Tests**: Still failing (19min runtime but functional issues remain)
- **Security Findings**: Need systematic remediation from code scanning
- **Governance Debt**: 44 total tasks need triage (addressed in cleanup plan)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Complete E2E refinement session** with technical team
2. **Prioritize security findings** remediation  
3. **Resolve task creation defect** (blocking instructor workflow)
4. **Continue governance cleanup** (Phase 2: Document consolidation)

## Context Notes

**MVP Status**: 3/4 pipelines GREEN (Backend, Frontend, Code Quality) âœ…
**Outstanding**: E2E pipeline stability and security hardening
**Governance**: Executing cleanup plan to reduce task overload from 44 â†’ 15 max
