## Implementation Details
- Updated `courseTypes.ts` to include a new `CourseError` interface with `message` and `code` properties
- Modified `courseService.ts` to return detailed error information for various network and API scenarios
- Added authentication token handling in all course-related service methods
- Implemented comprehensive error handling for authentication errors (401, 403)
- Enhanced error handling in `CoursesPage` and other components

## Changes Made
