## Description

Design and implement comprehensive RESTful API endpoints for learning task management.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Task Creation Endpoint
   - `POST /tasks/`
   - Accept task creation payload
   - Validate instructor permissions
   - Return created task details

2. Task Update Endpoint
   - `PUT /tasks/{id}/`
   - Support partial updates
   - Enforce role-based access control
   - Validate input data

3. Task Deletion Endpoint
   - `DELETE /tasks/{id}/`
   - Implement soft delete mechanism
   - Preserve task history
   - Restrict deletion based on permissions

4. Task Retrieval Endpoints
   - `GET /courses/{course_id}/tasks/`
     - Filter by visibility status
     - Support pagination
   - `GET /tasks/{id}/`
     - Retrieve detailed task information
     - Include submission and progress data

5. Task Submission Endpoints
   - `POST /tasks/{id}/submissions/`
   - `GET /tasks/{id}/submissions/`
   - Validate submission rules
   - Support file and text submissions

### Technical Requirements

- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Use Django REST Framework
- Create serializers for each endpoint
- Implement robust permission classes

## Validation Criteria

- [x] API follows RESTful principles
- [x] Secure access control is enforced
- [x] Data integrity checks are in place
- [x] Endpoints handle various use cases
- [x] Performance and scalability are considered

## Implementation Notes

- Use class-based views
- Implement custom permission classes
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Support filtering and searching
- Implement rate limiting

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All task management operations are supported
2. Permissions are strictly enforced
3. API is well-documented
4. Performance meets requirements
5. Error handling is comprehensive

## Estimated Effort

- Backend API Development: 8 story points
- Permission Implementation: 5 story points
- Documentation: 3 story points
- Total: 16 story points

## Potential Risks

- Complex permission logic
- Performance with large datasets
- Ensuring API consistency
- Managing different user roles
