## Description

Implement a comprehensive task progress tracking system for students and instructors.

## Business Context

The progress tracking system is essential for:

- Enabling students to monitor their learning journey
- Helping instructors identify struggling students early
- Supporting data-driven educational decisions
- Improving course completion rates

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Student Progress Dashboard
   - Display all assigned tasks
   - Show task completion status
   - Highlight pending and overdue tasks
   - Provide progress percentage
   - Visualize course-wide and individual task completion

2. Instructor Progress Monitoring
   - Aggregate student progress across course
   - Generate detailed progress reports
   - Identify students at risk of falling behind
   - Support intervention tracking

3. Progress Metrics
   - Calculate completion rates
   - Track time spent on tasks
   - Compare student performance
   - Generate predictive learning analytics
