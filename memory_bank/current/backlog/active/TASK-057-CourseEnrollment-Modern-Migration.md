## Architecture Impact

### Modern Auth Integration
```typescript
// Before (Legacy Pattern)
import { useAuth } from '@context/auth/AuthContext';
const { user } = useAuth();

// After (Modern Pattern)
import { useAuthStore } from '@/store/modernAuthStore';
const { user } = useAuthStore();
```

### Service Architecture Analysis
**Current Service Usage**:
- `courseService.getCourseDetails(courseId)` - Course information
- `enrollmentService.findByFilter({ course: Number(courseId) })` - Enrollment status
- `enrollmentService.create()` - Enrollment creation
- `enrollmentService.unenrollFromCourseById()` - Unenrollment

**Migration Assessment**:
- Verify if these services already use modern patterns from TASK-012
- Update service calls if needed to use modern architecture
- Maintain React Query integration patterns

### Component Architecture
- **Auth State**: Modern useAuthStore for user authentication
- **Service Integration**: Modern service patterns for course and enrollment data
- **React Query**: Maintain existing query and mutation patterns
- **Error Handling**: Consistent with modern service error patterns

---

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- ✅ **TASK-050**: Modern AuthStore implementation (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **TASK-055**: ProfilePage migration (auth migration template)
- ✅ **TASK-012**: Modern Service Architecture (foundation services available)
- ⚠️ **enrollmentService**: Verify modern compliance
- ⚠️ **courseService**: Verify modern compliance

### Dependency Impact
- **Templates**: Enrollment service migration pattern for other components
- **Enables**: Enrollment-related component migration patterns
- **Supports**: Phase 2B migration completion

---

## Service Integration Analysis

### Current Service Calls Analysis
**courseService.getCourseDetails(courseId)**:
- Returns: `ICourse`
- Usage: Course information display
- Migration needed: Verify modern service compliance

**enrollmentService.findByFilter({ course: Number(courseId) })**:
- Returns: Array of enrollments
- Usage: Check student enrollment status
- Migration needed: Verify modern service compliance

**enrollmentService.create()**:
- Usage: Create new enrollment
- Migration needed: Verify modern service compliance

**enrollmentService.unenrollFromCourseById(Number(courseId))**:
- Usage: Unenroll from course
- Migration needed: Verify modern service compliance

### React Query Integration
```typescript
// Current pattern (maintain if services are modern)
const { data: course } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['course', courseId],
  queryFn: () => courseService.getCourseDetails(courseId),
  enabled: Boolean(courseId),
});

const enrollMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: () => enrollmentService.create({
    course: Number(courseId),
    user: user ? Number(user.id) : undefined,
    status: 'active',
  }),
});
```

### Migration Strategy
1. **Service Verification**: Check if services use modern architecture patterns
2. **Selective Updates**: Update only services that need modernization
3. **React Query Compatibility**: Ensure modern services work with existing patterns
4. **Error Handling**: Update error handling to use modern service patterns

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach
```typescript
// Modern test mock pattern
import { useAuthStore } from '@/store/modernAuthStore';
import { enrollmentService } from '@/services/resources/enrollmentService';
import { courseService } from '@/services/resources/courseService';

jest.mock('@/store/modernAuthStore');
jest.mock('@/services/resources/enrollmentService');
jest.mock('@/services/resources/courseService');

const mockUseAuthStore = useAuthStore as jest.MockedFunction<typeof useAuthStore>;
```

### Test Coverage Areas
- **Auth Integration**: User data from modern auth store
- **Course Display**: courseService integration
- **Enrollment Status**: enrollmentService.findByFilter integration
- **Enrollment Actions**: create and unenroll mutation handling
- **Loading States**: Multi-service loading coordination
- **Error Handling**: Service error scenarios
- **User Flow**: Complete enrollment/unenrollment workflows

### E2E Test Impact
**Affected Tests**:
- Course enrollment workflow tests
- Course unenrollment workflow tests
- Student course access tests
- Enrollment status display tests

**Note**: E2E tests will be updated after all component migrations are complete.

## Notes

This task establishes the enrollment service migration template for Phase 2B. CourseEnrollment is strategically chosen because:

1. **Service Complexity**: Combines auth migration with multiple service dependencies
2. **Business Impact**: Core student enrollment workflow component
3. **Template Value**: Creates pattern for other enrollment-related components
4. **Service Integration**: Tests enrollment service architecture in real scenarios

Success here provides the foundation for migrating other enrollment-related components and validates the modern service architecture in complex user workflows.

The migration maintains React Query patterns while ensuring all underlying services use modern architecture, establishing a proven approach for service-heavy component migrations.
