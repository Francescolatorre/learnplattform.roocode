### Critical Business Questions Analysis

#### 1. Can the platform operate without this feature?
- **User Management**: NO - Cannot manage student/instructor accounts
- **System Monitoring**: NO - Cannot detect or respond to outages
- **Content Control**: NO - No quality assurance for educational materials
- **Basic Permissions**: NO - Security risk without access controls
- **Advanced Analytics**: YES - Manual processes can substitute temporarily
- **Compliance Auditing**: YES - Can implement retroactively

#### 2. How many workflows does this affect?
- **User Management**: 15+ workflows (registration, support, course access)
- **Content Moderation**: 8+ workflows (content creation, review, publication)
- **System Dashboard**: 5+ workflows (monitoring, incident response, maintenance)
- **Analytics**: 3+ workflows (reporting, decision making, optimization)

#### 3. What's the cost of not having this at launch?
- **No User Management**: Platform unusable - cannot onboard or support users
- **No Content Oversight**: Poor content quality, potential legal issues
- **No System Monitoring**: Extended outages, poor user experience
- **No Analytics**: Decisions based on assumptions, missed opportunities
