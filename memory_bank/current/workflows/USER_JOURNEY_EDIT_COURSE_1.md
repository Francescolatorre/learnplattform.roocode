# User Journey: Edit Course

## Findings and Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. User Roles and Permissions

- **Current State**: The system employs role-based access control, but the specific permissions for each role (e.g., instructor, student, admin) need to be clearly defined and documented.
- **Suggestion**: Create a detailed permissions matrix that outlines what actions each role can perform within the course management system.

### 2. Course Structure

- **Current State**: The LMS supports multiple versions of courses, but the management of these versions can be complex.
- **Suggestion**: Implement a user-friendly interface for instructors to manage course versions, including viewing version histories and switching between versions easily.

### 3. Assessment Mechanisms

- **Current State**: The platform includes AI-powered submission evaluation, but the assessment criteria and feedback mechanisms are not well-defined.
- **Suggestion**: Develop clear guidelines for assessment criteria and ensure that feedback is actionable and personalized for learners.

### 4. Communication Tools

- **Current State**: There is no mention of integrated communication tools for instructors and students.
- **Suggestion**: Consider integrating messaging or discussion forums to facilitate communication between users, enhancing collaboration and support.

### 5. Analytics

- **Current State**: Progress tracking is included, but detailed analytics on user engagement and performance are lacking.
- **Suggestion**: Implement analytics dashboards for instructors to monitor student progress, engagement rates, and course effectiveness.

### 6. Integrations

- **Current State**: The technology stack does not currently mention any third-party integrations.
- **Suggestion**: Explore potential integrations with tools like Google Classroom, Zoom, or other educational platforms to enhance functionality and user experience.

### 7. Accessibility Features

- **Current State**: The platform aims to comply with accessibility standards, but specific features are not detailed.
- **Suggestion**: Conduct an accessibility audit to identify areas for improvement and ensure that all features are usable by individuals with disabilities.

## Conclusion

## Integration with Learning Models

- The system allows trainers to delegate the analysis of written tasks to a language model (LLM), which can provide ratings and feedback based on specific prompts.
- This integration enhances the assessment process, providing more objective and consistent evaluations.

## User Experience Design

- A focus on user experience ensures that both instructors and students find the platform intuitive and easy to navigate.

## Creating Tasks

- Instructors can create various types of tasks within their courses, including:
  - **Writing Tasks**: Define tasks that require students to write articles on specific topics.
  - **Quiz Tasks**: Create quizzes that assess student understanding of course material.
- The process includes:
  - Accessing the task creation interface.
  - Filling out necessary details such as task title, description, due date, and type.
  - Submitting the task for inclusion in the course.

## Editing Tasks

- Instructors can edit existing tasks to update details or deadlines as needed.
- The editing process involves:
  - Navigating to the task management section.
  - Selecting the task to be edited.
  - Modifying the relevant fields (e.g., title, description, due date).
  - Saving the changes to update the task.

## Use Cases

1. **Creating a Writing Task**:
   - An instructor creates a task titled "Research Article on Climate Change" with a due date of two weeks from now. Students are required to submit their articles for review.

2. **Editing a Quiz Task**:
   - After reviewing student feedback, an instructor decides to extend the deadline for a quiz task from one week to two weeks. The instructor accesses the task management section, selects the quiz, and updates the due date.

3. **Delegating Task Analysis**:
   - A trainer receives student articles and chooses to delegate the analysis to an LLM, which will provide ratings based on a prompt. The trainer sets the criteria for the LLM to follow and submits the articles for automated evaluation.
