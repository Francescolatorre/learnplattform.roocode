## Description

Implement the frontend components and hooks required for the student course interaction user journey, enabling students to access course content, complete learning assignments, and track their progress.

## Requirements

- **Frontend Components**:
  - `CourseDetailsPage`:
    - Display course title, description, learning objectives, and learning assignments.
    - Link learning assignments to their respective task view pages.
  - `TaskViewPage`:
    - Display learning assignment title, description, and completion button.
    - Handle learning assignment completion logic.
  - `CourseProgressPage`:
    - Display overall course progress using a progress bar.
    - List learning assignments with their statuses.
- **Custom Hooks**:
  - `useCourseData`: Fetch course details from the backend.
  - `useTaskData`: Fetch learning assignment details from the backend.
  - `useCourseProgress`: Fetch course progress from the backend.

## Validation Criteria

1. All components render correctly with mock data.
2. API calls are made using the custom hooks and return the expected data.
3. Proper error handling is implemented for loading and API failures.
4. Components are styled consistently using Material UI.
5. Navigation between pages works as expected.

## Dependencies

- Backend API endpoints for course details, learning assignment details, and course progress.
- Material UI for UI components.
- React Query for data fetching and caching.

## Implementation Plan

1. Create the `CourseDetailsPage` to display course information and learning assignments.
2. Create the `TaskViewPage` to display learning assignment details and handle completion.
3. Create the `CourseProgressPage` to display overall course progress and learning assignment statuses.
4. Implement custom hooks for fetching course data, learning assignment data, and course progress.
