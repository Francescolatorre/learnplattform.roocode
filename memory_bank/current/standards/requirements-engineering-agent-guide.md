- Frontend tasks (React components, TypeScript interfaces)
- Testing strategy
- Database considerations

### 5. Architecture Consultation

**Prompt:**
```
How should we implement real-time notifications considering our current service architecture?
```

## Best Practices

### üéØ **When to Use the Agent**

**Ideal Scenarios:**
- New feature requirements need analysis
- Existing requirements need validation
- Implementation planning for complex features
- Architecture decisions for new functionality
- Task breakdown for development sprints

**Less Suitable For:**
- Simple bug fixes
- Minor UI changes
- Configuration updates
- Non-functional system tasks

### üìã **How to Write Effective Prompts**

**Good Prompts:**
```
‚úÖ "Analyze this requirement: [detailed requirement text]"
‚úÖ "Create a requirement for student progress tracking with analytics"
‚úÖ "Validate this quiz management requirement and identify gaps"
‚úÖ "Generate tasks for implementing course enrollment with prerequisites"
```

**Less Effective Prompts:**
```
‚ùå "Help me with requirements"
‚ùå "What should I build?"
‚ùå "Fix this requirement"
‚ùå "Make this better"
```

### üèóÔ∏è **Getting Better Results**

**Include Context:**
- Specify user role (student/instructor/admin)
- Mention related features or dependencies
- Include any constraints or preferences
- Reference existing functionality when relevant

**Be Specific:**
- Use concrete user stories when possible
- Include business objectives
- Mention performance requirements
- Specify integration points
