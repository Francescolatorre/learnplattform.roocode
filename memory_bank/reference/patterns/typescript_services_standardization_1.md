# TypeScript Services Standardization Initiative

**Status:** VALIDATED
**Last Updated:** 2025-04-12

> [2025-04-12] VALIDATED by Architect Mode. Requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria reviewed for completeness, clarity, risks, and alignment. Standard is feasible and ready for adoption. See Task_TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001.md for audit and migration details.

## 1. Initiative Overview

The goal of this initiative is to standardize the structure, implementation, and documentation of all TypeScript-based service modules within the project. This will improve maintainability, scalability, onboarding, and code quality across the codebase.

---

## 2. Drafted Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

- All TypeScript service modules must follow a unified folder and file naming convention.
- Each service must expose a consistent public API (method signatures, error handling, return types).
- Services must include comprehensive JSDoc/TSDoc comments for all public methods.
- Dependency injection or a standardized pattern for external dependencies must be used.
- All services must include unit tests with a minimum coverage threshold (e.g., 80%).
- Service modules must not contain business logic unrelated to their domain responsibility.
- All services must be compatible with the project's linting and formatting rules.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- Documentation for each service must be available and up-to-date.
- Services must be performant and avoid unnecessary resource consumption.
- The standardization process must not break existing integrations; migration guides must be provided.
- The standard must be reviewed and updated at least once per release cycle.

## 3. User Stories

### US-01: As a developer, I want all TypeScript services to have a consistent structure so that I can quickly understand and modify any service module

### US-02: As a new team member, I want clear documentation and examples for each service so that I can onboard efficiently

### US-03: As a code reviewer, I want to ensure that all services adhere to the standard so that code quality and maintainability are preserved

### US-04: As a product owner, I want the standardization to be non-disruptive to ongoing development so that project timelines are not negatively impacted

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A documented standard for TypeScript service modules exists and is accessible to all developers.
- [ ] All new TypeScript services created after the standard is published follow the standard.
- [ ] At least one existing service is refactored to demonstrate the standard.
- [ ] Automated linting and code review checks are updated to enforce the standard.
- [ ] Migration documentation is available for updating legacy services.
- [ ] Unit test coverage for all services meets or exceeds the defined threshold.
- [ ] The standard and its adoption are reviewed and approved by Architect Mode.

## 5. Next Steps

- Review and validate these drafted requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria in Architect Mode.
- Upon validation, update the status to VALIDATED and proceed with standardization planning.
