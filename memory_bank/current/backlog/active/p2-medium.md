## P2 Planning Strategy

### Sprint Integration
- **Capacity Allocation**: 20-30% of sprint capacity for P2 tasks
- **Filler Tasks**: Use P2 tasks to fill remaining capacity after P1 commitments
- **Stretch Goals**: P2 tasks make excellent stretch goals for high-velocity sprints

### Task Graduation
- **P2 â†’ P1**: Tasks can be promoted if business priority changes
- **P2 â†’ P3**: Tasks can be demoted if newer priorities emerge
- **Regular Review**: Weekly assessment of P2 task relevance and priority

### Batch Processing
- **Related Tasks**: Group related P2 tasks for efficient completion
- **Skill Specialization**: Assign P2 tasks based on developer strengths
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Use P2 tasks for mentoring and skill development

## Learning Platform P2 Focus Areas

### Student Experience Enhancements
- **Dashboard Improvements**: Better course overview and progress tracking
- **Mobile Experience**: Responsive design for mobile learning
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance for inclusive learning
- **Performance**: Faster page loads and smoother interactions

### Instructor Productivity
- **Grading Efficiency**: Batch operations and shortcuts
- **Analytics and Insights**: Data-driven teaching support
- **Course Management**: Advanced organization and planning tools
- **Communication**: Better student-instructor interaction tools

### System Quality
- **Performance Optimization**: Database, API, and frontend improvements
- **Code Quality**: Technical debt reduction and maintainability
- **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test suites for reliability
- **Documentation**: Developer and user documentation improvements

### Modern Architecture
- **Service Migration**: Continue TASK-012 Phase 2 at sustainable pace
- **API Evolution**: RESTful API improvements and consistency
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components and design system
- **Development Tools**: Better development experience and productivity

## P2 Task Management

### Prioritization Within P2
1. **User Impact**: Tasks affecting many users or core workflows
2. **Technical Risk**: Tasks addressing security, performance, or stability
3. **Development Efficiency**: Tasks improving team productivity
4. **Strategic Alignment**: Tasks supporting long-term architecture goals

### Capacity Planning
- **Available Capacity**: Fill remaining sprint capacity after P1 commitments
- **Developer Interest**: Consider team member interests and growth goals
- **Skill Development**: Use P2 tasks for learning new technologies
- **Risk Tolerance**: Choose appropriate complexity for available time

### Progress Tracking
- **Sprint Goals**: Clearly communicate which P2 tasks are committed vs. stretch
- **Velocity Impact**: Track P2 completion rate separately from P1
- **Value Measurement**: Assess user impact and business value of completed P2 tasks

## P2 Quality Standards

### Definition of Ready (P2-Specific)
- [ ] Business value clearly articulated
- [ ] User story format may be more flexible
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined but may be less detailed
- [ ] Technical approach sketched (detailed design during implementation)
- [ ] Story points estimated (may be rough)

### Definition of Done (Same as P1)
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] No regressions introduced

### Flexibility Guidelines
- **Scope Adjustment**: P2 tasks can be trimmed to fit available capacity
- **Implementation Choices**: Developers have more freedom in technical approach
- **Timeline Flexibility**: P2 tasks can be moved between sprints more easily
- **Quality Maintenance**: Quality standards remain the same as P1 tasks

## P2 Risk Management

### Acceptable Risks
- **Partial Completion**: P2 tasks can be partially completed if higher priorities emerge
- **Scope Reduction**: Features can be simplified to fit available time
- **Timeline Flexibility**: Delivery dates are targets, not commitments

### Risk Mitigation
- **Clear Expectations**: Communicate P2 tasks are "best effort"
- **Incremental Value**: Design P2 tasks to deliver value in phases
- **Backup Plans**: Have alternative P2 tasks ready if planned tasks are blocked

## P2 Success Metrics

### Completion Metrics
- **P2 Completion Rate**: Target 60-80% of selected P2 tasks completed
- **Value Delivery**: Focus on delivered business value over task count
- **Technical Debt**: P2 work should measurably reduce technical debt
- **User Satisfaction**: P2 improvements should be reflected in user feedback

### Process Metrics
- **Sprint Flexibility**: P2 tasks should provide sprint planning flexibility
- **Team Satisfaction**: P2 work should be engaging and educational
- **Knowledge Growth**: Team skills should expand through P2 task variety

## P2 Task Examples

### Well-Suited for P2
```markdown
TASK-XXX: Add keyboard shortcuts to task creation form
- User value: Improved instructor efficiency
- Low risk: UI enhancement only
- Educational: Good for junior developers
- Flexible: Can be simplified if needed
```

### Should Be P1 Instead
```markdown
TASK-XXX: Fix course enrollment timeout errors
- User blocking: Students cannot enroll
- High impact: Affects core functionality
- Time sensitive: Current semester enrollment period
- Business critical: Revenue impact
```

### Should Be P3 Instead
```markdown
TASK-XXX: Research AI-powered learning recommendations
- Unclear value: Benefits not proven
- High complexity: Significant research needed
- Low urgency: Nice-to-have feature
- Resource intensive: Requires specialized skills
```

**Note**: P2 tasks provide flexibility in sprint planning while delivering incremental value. They should enhance the system without compromising delivery of P1 commitments.
