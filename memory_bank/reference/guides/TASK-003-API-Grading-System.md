## Task Metadata

- **Task-ID:** TASK-003
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** High
- **Dependencies:** TASK-SUBMISSION-001

## Description

Develop a comprehensive grading system for task submissions with manual and AI-assisted grading capabilities.

## Business Context

The API grading system is essential for:

- Enabling scalable and consistent assessment of student work
- Reducing instructor workload through API automation
- Supporting real-time grade synchronization across the platform
- Facilitating integration with external learning tools
- Providing data-driven insights into student performance
- Ensuring secure and auditable grading processes

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Grading Interface
   - Create instructor dashboard for grading
   - Display submission details
   - Support manual grading workflow
   - Provide rubric-based grading options

2. AI-Assisted Grading
   - Implement machine learning grading suggestions
   - Provide confidence scores for AI recommendations
   - Allow instructors to accept or override AI grades
   - Support multiple grading criteria

3. Grading History & Tracking
   - Record all grading actions
   - Track grade changes and reasons
   - Support grade appeals mechanism
   - Generate comprehensive grade reports

### Technical Requirements

- Frontend: Create advanced grading dashboard
- Backend: Implement grading logic and AI integration
- Machine Learning: Develop grading recommendation model
- Database: Design comprehensive grading tracking schema

## Validation Criteria

- [x] Only course instructors can grade submissions
- [x] Grades are recorded and linked to tasks
- [x] AI-assisted grading works as expected
- [x] Grading history is preserved
- [x] Grade appeals process is supported

## Implementation Notes
