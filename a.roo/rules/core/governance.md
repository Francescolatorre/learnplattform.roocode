Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: 2025-06-10

## Overview
This document establishes the fundamental governance principles for the Roo code modules system. It serves as the primary reference for all role-specific rules and processes.

## Scope
These principles apply to all Roo operations, roles, and processes within the learning platform codebase.

## Core Principles

### 1. Role-Based Responsibility
- Each role (Architect, Code, Debug, Digital Design) has specific responsibilities and constraints
- Roles must operate within their defined boundaries
- Cross-role collaboration follows established escalation procedures

### 2. Task Management
- All tasks must follow standardized templates and workflows
- Clear documentation of requirements and validation criteria
- Proper status tracking and updates throughout task lifecycle

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Mandatory testing requirements for code changes
- Architectural review for significant changes
- Consistent code style and documentation standards

### 4. Documentation Standards
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for key decisions
- Clear version tracking for all rule documents
- Cross-referenced documentation for related processes
