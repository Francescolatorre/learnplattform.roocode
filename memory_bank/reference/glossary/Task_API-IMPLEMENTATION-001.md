# Task Definition: API Implementation According to OpenAPI Specification

## Task ID
TASK-API-IMPLEMENTATION-001

## Status
IN_PROGRESS

## Type
Implementation

## Priority
High

## Description
Implement the API endpoints for the Learning Platform backend according to the provided OpenAPI specification. This task involves extending the existing models, creating serializers, implementing views/viewsets, and configuring URLs to match the API specification.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Implement authentication endpoints (register, login, logout, password reset, profile, token refresh) ✅
2. Implement course management endpoints (list, create, retrieve, update, delete courses) ✅
3. Implement task management endpoints (learning tasks, multiple choice quizzes, submissions) ✅
4. Implement health check endpoint ✅
5. Ensure all endpoints match the OpenAPI specification provided ⏳

### Technical Requirements
1. Use Django REST Framework with JWT authentication ✅
2. Extend existing models to support all required fields ✅
3. Create proper serializers for data validation and transformation ✅
4. Implement views and viewsets for handling API endpoints ✅
5. Configure URLs according to the API specification ⏳
6. Generate OpenAPI schema that matches the provided specification ❌

### Acceptance Criteria
1. All API endpoints are implemented according to the OpenAPI specification ⏳
2. Authentication system works correctly with JWT tokens ✅
3. Course management endpoints allow CRUD operations on courses ✅
4. Task management endpoints support all required operations ✅
5. API documentation is generated and matches the provided specification ❌
6. All endpoints pass manual testing ❌

## Dependencies
- Existing models in core/models.py
- Django project setup

## Resources
- [API Implementation Plan ADR](../ADRs/api_implementation_plan.md)
- OpenAPI specification provided by the user

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Model Extensions ✅
1. Install required packages (djangorestframework, djangorestframework-simplejwt) ✅
2. Update settings.py with REST Framework and JWT configurations ✅
3. Extend existing models to support all required fields ✅
4. Run migrations to update the database schema ✅

### Phase 2: Authentication API ✅
1. Implement User serializers (registration, login, profile) ✅
2. Create authentication views (register, login, logout, profile) ✅
3. Configure authentication URLs ✅

### Phase 3: Course API ✅
1. Implement Course serializer ✅
2. Create CourseViewSet for handling course operations ✅
3. Configure course URLs ✅

### Phase 4: Task API ✅
1. Implement LearningTask serializers ✅
2. Create LearningTaskViewSet for handling task operations ✅
3. Implement MultipleChoiceQuiz serializers and viewsets ✅
4. Configure task URLs ✅

### Phase 5: Testing and Documentation ❌
1. Test all API endpoints manually ❌
2. Generate OpenAPI schema ❌
3. Create API documentation ❌
4. Verify that the generated schema matches the provided specification ❌

## Remaining Tasks
1. Create a urls.py file in the core app to better organize URL patterns
2. Install drf-spectacular or similar tool for API schema generation
3. Generate API documentation
4. Perform comprehensive manual testing of all endpoints
5. Verify the API implementation against the OpenAPI specification

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Existing models may not fully support the required fields
  - **Mitigation**: Carefully extend models and use migrations to update the schema

- **Risk**: Authentication system may have security vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Follow best practices for JWT implementation and test thoroughly

- **Risk**: API endpoints may not match the OpenAPI specification exactly
  - **Mitigation**: Use drf-spectacular to generate the schema and compare with the provided specification

## Estimated Effort
- 1-2 days to complete remaining tasks
