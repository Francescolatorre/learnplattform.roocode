# ADR-007: Model Consolidation Review

## Current Model Landscape

### Courses

- Multiple Course model implementations across apps
- Varying levels of detail and attributes
- Inconsistent foreign key relationships

### Tasks

- Complex inheritance structure in tasks app
- Multiple task type models
- Overlapping responsibilities

### User

- Custom User model in learningplatform
- Extended AbstractUser
- Additional profile information

## Consolidation Recommendations

### Course Model

- Use learningplatform/models.py Course model as base
- Incorporate additional attributes from courses/models.py
  - Add duration
  - Add difficulty level
- Standardize foreign key relationships

### Task Model

- Adopt learningplatform/models.py Task model
- Support multiple task types via `task_type` field
- Include scoring and deadline attributes
- Remove complex inheritance structure

### User Model

- Use learningplatform/models.py User model
- Extend AbstractUser
- Keep bio and profile picture attributes

## Implementation Strategy

1. Update models in learningplatform app
2. Remove redundant models from other apps
3. Update serializers and views
4. Regenerate test data
5. Verify model relationships and functionality

## Risks

- Potential breaking changes in existing code
- Need for comprehensive testing
- Ensuring all app functionalities remain intact

## Next Actions

- Draft model update plan
- Create updated model definitions
- Update related serializers
- Modify test data generation scripts
- Develop comprehensive test suite

## Status

Accepted
