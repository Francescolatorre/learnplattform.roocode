#### Response Process:
1. **Planning:** Include in next sprint planning
2. **Resources:** Assign senior developers
3. **Communication:** Weekly stakeholder updates
4. **Timeline:** Complete within 2 sprints maximum
5. **Quality:** Full testing cycle required

### P2 - Medium Priority (Important)
**Timeline:** Should be addressed within 2-4 sprints
**Business Impact:** Feature improvements, moderate bugs, technical debt

#### Criteria:
- [ ] **Enhancements:** Valuable improvements to existing features
- [ ] **User Experience:** Moderate usability improvements
- [ ] **Technical Debt:** Code maintainability and architecture improvements
- [ ] **Performance:** Non-critical performance optimizations
- [ ] **Documentation:** Important documentation gaps

#### Examples:
- Adding new filters to course search
- Improving error messaging throughout the application
- Refactoring legacy services to modern architecture
- Adding analytics and reporting features
- Mobile responsiveness improvements

#### Response Process:
1. **Scheduling:** Include when sprint capacity allows
2. **Resources:** Can be assigned to junior/mid-level developers
3. **Communication:** Monthly progress updates
4. **Timeline:** Flexible based on team capacity
5. **Quality:** Standard testing requirements

### P3 - Low Priority (Nice to Have)
**Timeline:** Address when convenient (backlog)
**Business Impact:** Future value, experiments, minor improvements

#### Criteria:
- [ ] **Future Value:** Features for potential future needs
- [ ] **Experiments:** Research and proof-of-concept work
- [ ] **Polish:** Minor UI/UX improvements
- [ ] **Optimization:** Non-essential optimizations
- [ ] **Documentation:** Nice-to-have documentation

#### Examples:
- Dark mode theme implementation
- Advanced analytics dashboards
- Experimental features for user testing
- Code quality improvements without user impact
- Additional language translations

#### Response Process:
1. **Backlog:** Keep in backlog for future consideration
2. **Resources:** Good for learning projects or slack time
3. **Communication:** Quarterly backlog review
4. **Timeline:** No specific timeline commitment
5. **Quality:** Can be more experimental, lighter testing

## Priority Assessment Framework

### Business Impact Scoring
Rate each criterion from 1-5:

#### User Impact (1-5)
- **5:** Critical user workflows completely blocked
- **4:** Major user workflows significantly impaired
- **3:** Important user workflows have workarounds
- **2:** Minor user convenience affected
- **1:** No immediate user impact

#### Business Value (1-5)
- **5:** Direct revenue impact or legal requirement
- **4:** Significant competitive advantage or user retention
- **3:** Important feature for user satisfaction
- **2:** Nice-to-have improvement
- **1:** Experimental or future consideration

#### Technical Risk (1-5)
- **5:** System stability at risk
- **4:** Performance significantly degraded
- **3:** Maintainability concerns
- **2:** Minor technical debt
- **1:** No technical risk

#### Urgency (1-5)
- **5:** Immediate action required
- **4:** Must be done soon to avoid escalation
- **3:** Should be done in reasonable timeframe
- **2:** Can wait for appropriate time
- **1:** No time pressure

### Priority Calculation
- **Total Score 16-20:** P0 (Critical)
- **Total Score 12-15:** P1 (High)
- **Total Score 8-11:** P2 (Medium)
- **Total Score 4-7:** P3 (Low)

## Special Considerations

### Modern Service Migration Priority
Given the current Phase 2 modernization:
- **High-traffic components:** Automatic P1 priority
- **Components with performance issues:** P1 priority
- **Components being actively developed:** P1 priority
- **Legacy components with minimal usage:** P2 priority

### Technical Debt Prioritization
- **Security-related debt:** P1
- **Performance-related debt:** P1-P2 based on impact
- **Maintainability debt:** P2-P3 based on frequency of changes
- **Code style/formatting:** P3

### Dependency Management
- **Blocking P0/P1 items:** Inherit higher priority
- **Blocked by external dependencies:** May reduce priority
- **Cross-team dependencies:** Require coordination planning

## Priority Change Process

### When to Re-evaluate Priority
- [ ] Business requirements change
- [ ] Technical landscape shifts
- [ ] User feedback indicates different impact
- [ ] Dependencies resolve or become blocked
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities discovered

### Priority Change Approval
- **P0 ↔ P1:** Technical Lead approval required
- **P1 ↔ P2:** Product Owner approval required
- **P2 ↔ P3:** Team consensus sufficient
- **Any to P0:** Incident management process

### Communication Requirements
- **Priority Increase:** Notify all stakeholders within 24 hours
- **Priority Decrease:** Include in next status update
- **Rationale:** Document reason for change
- **Impact:** Assess effect on sprint plans and commitments

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Priority Distribution Health
- **P0:** Should be < 5% of backlog (emergency items only)
- **P1:** Should be 15-25% of backlog (manageable urgent work)
- **P2:** Should be 40-50% of backlog (main development focus)
- **P3:** Should be 25-40% of backlog (future opportunities)

### Response Time Targets
- **P0:** Resolution within 24 hours
- **P1:** Started within 1 sprint, completed within 2 sprints
- **P2:** Started within 4 sprints
- **P3:** No specific timeline commitment

### Review Schedule
- **P0/P1:** Weekly review and update
- **P2:** Bi-weekly review
- **P3:** Monthly review for relevance
