## Requirements

### User Stories

```gherkin
Feature: Task Deletion

  Scenario: Instructor deletes a task that no student has started
    Given I am logged in as an Instructor or Admin
    And I am viewing the course task list
    And the task has not been started by any student
    Then I see a delete button for the task
    When I click the delete button for the task
    And I confirm the deletion
    Then the task is deleted
    And a success notification is shown
    And the task is no longer visible to students

  Scenario: Instructor views a task already started by a student
    Given I am logged in as an Instructor or Admin
    And at least one student has started the task
    Then I do not see a delete button for the task
    And I see an info icon or tooltip explaining why deletion is not possible
    And the tooltip shows how many students have this task in progress or done

  Scenario: Instructor aborts deletion
    Given I am logged in as an Instructor or Admin
    When I click the delete button for a task
    And I abort the confirmation dialog
    Then the task is not deleted
    And no changes occur

  Scenario: Unauthorized user attempts deletion
    Given I am logged in as a Student
    When I view the course task list
    Then I do not see a delete button for any task

  Scenario: Audit log entry for deletion
    Given a task is deleted by an Instructor or Admin
    Then an audit log entry is created with user, timestamp, and task details
```

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Only Instructors or Admins can see and use the delete button for tasks.
2. The delete button is only shown for tasks that have not been started by any student.
3. For tasks already started by students, no delete button is shown; instead, an info icon or tooltip explains why deletion is not possible and displays the number of students with the task in progress or done.
4. Clicking the delete button prompts a confirmation dialog ("Are you sure?" with Yes and Abort).
5. If Yes is selected, the task is deleted and a success notification is shown.
6. If Abort is selected, no action is taken.
7. Tasks not started by any student can be deleted.
8. Deleted tasks are no longer visible to students who have not started them.
9. Tasks already started remain visible to those students, but are not accessible to others.

### Technical Requirements

* Role-based access control for delete action.
* Confirmation dialog implementation.
* Backend logic to check student progress before deletion.
* Notification system for success and error states.
* Audit logging for task deletions.
* API endpoint: DELETE /api/courses/{courseId}/tasks/{taskId}
* **ALL TASK MANAGEMENT INTERFACES** must be updated:
  - InstructorCourseDetailsPage (/instructor/courses/{id}) - inline task list
  - InstructorTasksPage (/instructor/courses/{id}/tasks) - dedicated task management page
* Backend task service and progress tracking modules require adjustment.
* Ensure concurrency safety for simultaneous deletion attempts.
* Regression tests for task list and student views on **BOTH** interfaces.

## Implementation

### Technical Approach

* UI: Show delete button only for tasks not started by any student; add info icon or tooltip for non-deletable tasks, including counts of students in progress or done.
* Backend: Endpoint to handle deletion with progress check and provide counts of students with the task in progress or done.
* Update task visibility logic for students.
* Notification and error handling.

### Dependencies

* User authentication and role management.
* Task progress tracking.
* Notification system.

### Test Strategy

* **Unit Tests:**
  * Delete button visibility for different roles.
  * Confirmation dialog logic.
  * Backend deletion logic with/without student progress.
* **Integration Tests:**
  * End-to-end deletion flow.
  * Edge case: students in progress.

### Blind Spots & Open Questions

**Tooltip Content:**
* Show a breakdown: e.g., "3 students in progress, 2 students completed".

**Student List Visibility:**
* Start with just the counts. Optionally, allow instructors to expand for a list of affected students (names only), if privacy policy allows.

**Race Condition Handling:**
* Backend must always block deletion if a student starts the task after UI load. UI should show an error notification if deletion fails due to late progress.

**Soft-Delete/Undo:**
* Strongly recommend a soft-delete (archived state) with an undo option for a short period (e.g., 30 seconds), and permanent deletion after that.

**Notifications:**
* Notify instructors of successful/failed deletions. Student notification only if the task was visible to them and is now removed/archived (passive notification).

**Audit & Retention:**
* Retain audit logs for at least 1 year. Instructors should have access to a deletion history for their courses; full audit log is admin-only.

**Bulk Actions:**
* Not required for MVP, but design backend/UI for future extension to bulk deletion.

**Accessibility:**
* All tooltips and info icons must be accessible (screen reader text, keyboard focusable, ARIA labels).

### Implementation Notes

* Confirm edge case handling for students in progress.
* Ensure all affected frontend (InstructorDashboardPage, task list, student views) and backend (task API, progress tracking, audit log) modules are updated.
* API must provide counts for both "in progress" and "done" statuses.
* All error and info messages must be clear, actionable, and consistent in tone.
* Document the deletion/archival process in the instructor help section.
* Consider analytics for task deletion frequency and reasons (optional, for future).

### Future Considerations

* Soft-delete for audit/history with undo option.
* Bulk deletion support.
* Notification system for affected students.
* Admin dashboard for audit log review.

### ⚠️ **CRITICAL LESSONS LEARNED**

#### **Scope Discovery Issue (2025-09-09)**
**Problem**: Initially implemented delete functionality only on `InstructorCourseDetailsPage.tsx` but missed the dedicated task management page `InstructorTasksPage.tsx` at `/instructor/courses/{id}/tasks`.

**Root Cause**: 
- Task specification didn't explicitly enumerate ALL task management interfaces
- Discovery process didn't include comprehensive UI audit for task management locations
- Assumed single task management interface without verification

**Resolution**:
- Added delete functionality to `InstructorTasksPage.tsx`
- Created comprehensive E2E tests covering both interfaces
- Updated documentation to explicitly list all affected interfaces

**Prevention Measures**:
1. **UI Discovery Protocol**: For any task affecting "task management", always:
   ```bash
   # 1. Search for all task-related pages
   find frontend/src -name "*.tsx" -exec grep -l "task\|Task" {} \;
   
   # 2. Search for all task management routes
   grep -r "tasks\|Task" frontend/src/routes/
   
   # 3. Search for components that display task lists
   grep -r "LearningTask\|ILearningTask" frontend/src/
   ```

2. **Scope Verification Checklist**: Before implementation, verify:
   - [ ] All pages where tasks are displayed
   - [ ] All pages where tasks can be managed
   - [ ] All user roles that interact with tasks
   - [ ] All routes containing task-related functionality

3. **Documentation Standard**: Always specify:
   ```markdown
   **UI INTERFACES AFFECTED:**
   - Page 1: /path/to/page - Description
   - Page 2: /path/to/page - Description  
   - Component: ComponentName.tsx - Description
   ```

This scope miss cost 2+ hours of additional implementation and could have been prevented with better discovery protocols.
