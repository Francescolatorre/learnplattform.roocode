- **Notes**: Define the relationships between the models in the learning platform.

## Description
Establish the relationships between the core models in the learning platform. This includes defining foreign keys, many-to-many relationships, and any other necessary relationships to support the platform's features.

## Requirements
1. **User Model**:
   - Relationships:
     - One-to-Many with Course model (instructor)
     - One-to-Many with Assessment model (user)

2. **Course Model**:
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-One with User model (instructor)
     - One-to-Many with Task model (course)

3. **Task Model**:
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-One with Course model (course)
     - One-to-Many with Assessment model (task)

4. **Assessment Model**:
   - Relationships:
     - Many-to-One with Task model (task)
     - Many-to-One with User model (user)

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use Django's ORM to define the relationships.
- Ensure that the relationships are correctly mapped to the database tables.
- Add any necessary indexes to optimize query performance.
- Validate the relationships using Django's migration system.

## Validation
- Run Django migrations to create the relationships.
- Populate the database with test data.
- Verify that the relationships support the required features.
- Ensure that the relationships are scalable and maintainable.

## Dependencies
- TASK-MODEL-001 (Database Schema)

## Notes
- This task is a critical part of the technical foundations phase.
- Ensure that the relationships are designed to be scalable and maintainable.
