## Current Phase & Status

- Phase: Implementation & Testing
- Overall Status: Multiple high-priority tasks in progress
- Focus Areas: TypeScript standardization, test fixes, and service improvements

## Active Tasks & Progress

### High Priority Tasks

- [Task_TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001](tasks/Task_TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001.md) [IN_PROGRESS]
  - Implement ADR-013 requirements
  - Standardize service structure
  - Update testing and documentation
- [TASK-TEST-006](tasks/TASK-TEST-006-fix-taskcreation-tests.md) [TODO]
  - Fix TaskCreation component tests
  - Update skipped test implementations
- [Task_REACT-HOOK-COMPLIANCE](tasks/Task_REACT-HOOK-COMPLIANCE-001.md) [IN_PROGRESS]
  - Review and update React hooks usage
  - Ensure compliance with best practices

### Upcoming Tasks

- **API Implementation Completion** (TASK-API-IMPLEMENTATION-COMPLETION) [TODO]
- **Course Creation Feature** (TASK-CREATION-001) [TODO]
- **Implement Task Progress Tracking UI** (TASK-UI-005) [TODO]
- **Model Consolidation Task** (TASK-MODEL-CONSOLIDATION-002) [TODO]

### Planned Features

- **Adaptive Assessment** (TASK-ADAPTIVE-ASSESSMENT) [TODO]
- **Skill Progression Tracking** (TASK-SKILL-PROGRESSION-TRACKING) [TODO]
- **AI-Powered Submission Evaluation** (TASK-AI-POWERED-SUBMISSION) [TODO]
- **Course Exploration and Enrollment** (TASK-COURSE-EXPLORATION) [TODO]

## Blockers & Challenges

- Task Progress Tracking UI implementation blocked pending API completion
- React Hook compliance updates may impact multiple components
- TaskCreation tests need fixes for CI pipeline stability

## Resource Requirements

- Frontend developer focus needed for TypeScript services standardization
- QA resources needed for comprehensive testing post-hook updates
- Documentation review required for updated service architecture

## Next Steps

- Begin TypeScript Services Standardization implementation
- Archive obsolete task files to memory_bank/archive/
- Update progress.md to reflect the consolidated task list
- Rename task files to follow consistent naming convention
- Update project_status.md to align with the consolidated view

## Recent Changes

- Consolidated task structure to eliminate obsolete and duplicate tasks
- Created comprehensive task overview in `tasks/Documentation_overview.md`
- Identified inconsistencies in task status tracking across different files
- Completed implementation of Progress Tracking API Endpoints (TASK-003)
- Completed implementation of Progress Tracking Frontend Components (TASK-002)
- Completed implementation of Task Progress Tracking UI (TASK-UI-005)
- Added simplified test for TaskCreation component with skipped tests (TASK-TEST-006)
