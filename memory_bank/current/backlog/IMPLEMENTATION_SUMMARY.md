## Priority System Implementation

### P0 - Critical (Emergency Response)
**Target State**: Empty except during genuine emergencies
- System outages, security breaches, data loss
- 24-48 hour resolution requirement
- All team resources available
- Interrupt all other work

### P1 - High Priority (Sprint Commitment)
**Target Capacity**: 70% of sprint (15-17 story points)
- Core functionality, user-blocking issues
- Complete within current sprint (1-2 weeks)
- Strong stakeholder commitments
- Quality gates fully enforced

### P2 - Medium Priority (Planned Enhancement)
**Target Capacity**: 20% of sprint (4-5 story points)
- Feature improvements, technical debt reduction
- Complete within 2-4 weeks
- Flexible scheduling based on P1 completion
- Fill remaining capacity after P1 commitment

### P3 - Low Priority (Innovation/Research)
**Target Capacity**: 10% of sprint (2-3 story points)
- Future features, experimental work
- Complete when capacity allows (1+ months)
- Learning opportunities, stretch goals
- First to be cancelled if higher priorities emerge

## Learning Platform Integration

### Modern Service Migration (TASK-012 Phase 2)
The backlog system specifically supports the ongoing TypeScript service migration:

**P1 Tasks**:
- TASK-027-B: Modern Service State Integration (5 pts)
- Component migrations: TaskCreation, CourseDetails, Enrollment (3-5 pts each)

**P2 Tasks**:
- Legacy service deprecation warnings (2 pts)
- Bundle size optimization (3 pts)
- Performance monitoring (3 pts)

**P3 Tasks**:
- Complete legacy removal (Epic-level)
- Advanced performance optimization (Research)

### User Journey Alignment
**Student Journey**: Task submission → progress tracking → feedback receipt
- P1: Fix critical grading bugs, real-time progress updates
- P2: Enhanced dashboard, mobile responsiveness
- P3: AI-powered recommendations, advanced analytics

**Instructor Journey**: Course creation → task management → grading workflow
- P1: Batch grading interface, instructor productivity tools
- P2: Advanced course analytics, improved task management
- P3: AI-assisted grading, collaborative course development

### Technical Architecture Support
- **Service Layer**: Modern vs legacy service tracking
- **Database**: Query optimization and performance monitoring
- **API**: RESTful improvements and caching strategies
- **Frontend**: Component migration and bundle optimization

## Task Templates and Standards

### Template Selection Guide
- **task-template.md**: Standard features, enhancements, bug fixes
- **epic-template.md**: Large initiatives requiring multiple sprints
- **defect-template.md**: Bug reports with reproduction steps
- **spike-template.md**: Research tasks with time-boxed investigation

### Quality Standards Applied
- **Definition of Ready**: Requirements clarity, technical understanding, estimation
- **Definition of Done**: Code quality, testing, documentation, deployment readiness
- **Learning Platform Specific**: Service patterns, user roles, performance, security

## Sprint Planning Integration

### Capacity Framework
- **Total Team Capacity**: 24 story points per sprint (example)
- **Availability Factor**: 70% (accounting for meetings, reviews, support)
- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks standard (1-3 week flexibility)

### Sprint Planning Process
1. **Pre-Planning**: Backlog grooming, dependency review, capacity assessment
2. **Sprint Planning**: Goal definition, task selection, breakdown validation
3. **Daily Management**: Standup integration, progress tracking, blocker resolution
4. **Retrospective**: Velocity assessment, process improvement, lessons learned

### Velocity Tracking
- **Historical Baseline**: Track 3-5 sprint average velocity
- **Task Type Analysis**: Different estimates for bugs vs features vs refactoring
- **Estimation Improvement**: Regular calibration based on actual vs estimated effort

## Dependency Management

### Critical Path Identification
The system tracks dependency chains like:
1. Modern Service State Integration → Component Migrations → Legacy Deprecation
2. Database Optimization → Performance Features → Real-time Updates
3. Integration Tests → E2E Coverage → Performance Testing

### Blocker Resolution
- **Level 1**: Team-level resolution (0-2 days)
- **Level 2**: Project-level escalation (2-5 days)
- **Level 3**: Organization-level decisions (5+ days)

### Risk Mitigation
- **Parallel Development**: Independent work streams
- **Incremental Delivery**: Breaking large dependencies into smaller pieces
- **Contingency Planning**: Alternative approaches for high-risk dependencies

## Migration Strategy for Existing Tasks

### Phase 1: Analysis and Classification (2 days)
- Complete inventory of memory_bank task files
- Priority assessment using new criteria
- Quality gate validation for Definition of Ready

### Phase 2: Restructuring and Enhancement (2 days)
- Convert tasks to new templates
- Add Learning Platform specific context
- Create comprehensive dependency mapping

### Phase 3: Backlog Population (1 day)
- Populate priority files with migrated tasks
- Update planning documents with new structure
- Integrate current sprint with new tracking

### Phase 4: Validation and Rollout (1 day)
- Team review and training
- Process validation and adjustment
- Legacy system transition

## Operational Guidelines
