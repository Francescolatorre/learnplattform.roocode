## P3 Evaluation Framework

### Promotion to P2 Criteria
A P3 task should be promoted to P2 when:
- [ ] Business value becomes clear and measurable
- [ ] User demand is demonstrated (feedback, requests)
- [ ] Technical feasibility is validated
- [ ] Resource requirements are reasonable
- [ ] Fits within product roadmap and strategy

### Promotion to P1 Criteria
A P3 task should jump to P1 when:
- [ ] Becomes critical for business objectives
- [ ] Competitor advantage requires immediate action
- [ ] Regulatory or compliance requirements emerge
- [ ] Major customer or partnership depends on it

### Cancellation Criteria
A P3 task should be cancelled when:
- [ ] Technology becomes obsolete or deprecated
- [ ] Business model changes eliminate need
- [ ] Cost-benefit analysis shows negative ROI
- [ ] Resources better allocated elsewhere
- [ ] User research shows no interest or value
