# ADR-012: Centralized Frontend Error Notification System

**Status:** ACCEPTED
**Date:** 2025-04-11
**Context:**
The frontend application lacked a unified, accessible, and extensible mechanism for displaying error notifications to users. Previous ad-hoc approaches led to inconsistent user experiences, duplicated logic, and challenges in maintaining accessibility and testability. A robust solution was required to standardize error handling and notification across the React/TypeScript codebase, leveraging Material UI and the React Context API.

## Problem Statement

- Inconsistent error notification patterns across the frontend.
- Lack of centralized control for error display, making it difficult to ensure accessibility and maintainability.
- Need for a solution that is easily extensible, testable, and integrates with existing UI frameworks.

## Requirements & Acceptance Criteria

- **Accessibility:** Error notifications must be accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies.
- **Extensibility:** The system should allow for future enhancements (e.g., different notification types, custom actions).
- **Centralization:** All error notifications should be managed via a single provider/context.
- **Integration:** Must integrate seamlessly with Material UI components and the existing React Context API.
- **Test Coverage:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests must be provided.
- **Developer Experience:** Simple API for triggering error notifications from any component.

## Decision & Rationale

A centralized error notification system was implemented using the React Context API and Material UI. This approach provides a single source of truth for error state, ensures consistent rendering of error toasts, and simplifies integration for developers. The Context API enables any component to trigger error notifications without prop drilling, while Material UI ensures a polished, accessible UI.

## High-Level Solution Overview

- **ErrorProvider:**
  A React context provider that manages the error state and exposes methods for triggering and clearing error notifications.

- **ErrorToast:**
  A Material UI-based component responsible for rendering error messages as toasts/snackbars, ensuring accessibility and visual consistency.

- **useNotification:**
  A custom React hook that allows any component to trigger error notifications via the ErrorProvider context.

- **Integration Points:**
  - ErrorProvider wraps the application (typically at the root or layout level).
  - Components use the useNotification hook to trigger errors.
  - ErrorToast is rendered within the provider to display notifications.

## References to Implementation

- `frontend/src/components/ErrorNotifier/ErrorProvider.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ErrorNotifier/ErrorToast.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/ErrorNotifier/useErrorNotifier.ts`
- Example usage/tests:
  `frontend/src/components/ErrorNotifier/ErrorNotifier.test.tsx`

## Key Risks, Dependencies, and Future Considerations

- **Dependencies:**
  - Relies on Material UI for UI components and accessibility features.
  - Depends on React Context API; excessive error events could cause unnecessary re-renders if not managed carefully.

- **Risks:**
  - Overuse of global error notifications may lead to notification fatigue for users.
  - Future changes to Material UI or React Context API could require refactoring.

- **Future Considerations:**
  - Support for additional notification types (success, warning, info).
  - Customizable notification actions (e.g., retry, details).
  - Integration with backend error logging/monitoring systems.
  - Internationalization/localization of error messages.

**Decision Log:**
This ADR documents the adoption of a centralized error notification system in the frontend, meeting all specified requirements and acceptance criteria. The solution is now the standard for error handling and notification in the React/TypeScript codebase.
