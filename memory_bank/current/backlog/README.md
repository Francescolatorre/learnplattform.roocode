# Learning Platform Backlog Management System

## Overview
This is the comprehensive backlog management system for the Learning Platform project. It provides structured templates, clear processes, and priority-based organization to ensure efficient development workflow and predictable delivery.

## System Components

### 📁 Directory Structure
```

│   ├── P0/              # Critical - Emergency response (< 5% of backlog)
│   ├── P1/              # High - Must address in 1-2 sprints (15-25%)
│   ├── P2/              # Medium - Should address in 2-4 sprints (40-50%)
│   └── P3/              # Low - Nice to have, no timeline (25-40%)

### 🎯 Priority System
- **P0 (Critical):** System down, security vulnerability, data loss risk
- **P1 (High):** Core feature impaired, significant performance issues
- **P2 (Medium):** Feature improvements, moderate bugs, technical debt
- **P3 (Low):** Future features, experiments, minor improvements

### 📋 Templates Available
- **Task Template:** Complete template for individual development tasks
- **Epic Template:** Template for large initiatives spanning multiple sprints
- **Sprint Planning:** Template for structured sprint planning sessions

## Quick Start Guide

### Creating a New Task
1. **Copy Template:** Use `templates/task-template.md`
2. **Assign ID:** Use next available TASK-XXX number
3. **Complete Sections:** Fill all required fields
4. **Assess Priority:** Use priority guidelines
5. **Place in Folder:** Move to appropriate priority folder

### Sprint Planning
1. **Use Template:** Copy `templates/sprint-planning-template.md`
2. **Assess Capacity:** Follow capacity planning guide
3. **Select Tasks:** Priority-first approach (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3)
4. **Verify Readiness:** Ensure all tasks meet Definition of Ready
5. **Document Plan:** Complete sprint planning template

### Task Management
- **Daily Updates:** Update task status during standups
- **Definition of Ready:** Use before starting any task
- **Definition of Done:** Use before marking task complete
- **Priority Changes:** Follow approval process in workflow procedures

## Process Guidelines

### Priority Assessment Framework
Use the scoring system in `process/priority-guidelines.md`:
- **User Impact (1-5):** How many users affected and how severely
- **Business Value (1-5):** Revenue, competitive advantage, compliance
- **Technical Risk (1-5):** System stability and performance impact
- **Urgency (1-5):** Time sensitivity and escalation risk

**Total Score:** 16-20 = P0, 12-15 = P1, 8-11 = P2, 4-7 = P3

### Quality Gates
- **Definition of Ready:** Task can be started confidently
- **Definition of Done:** Task delivers complete value
- **Code Review:** All changes peer reviewed
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and E2E tests required

### Capacity Planning
- **Individual Capacity:** 32 development hours per week per developer
- **Sprint Capacity:** Account for meetings, reviews, and complexity
- **Story Points:** Use Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- **Velocity Tracking:** Rolling 3-6 sprint average for forecasting

## Current State and Migration

### Modern Service Migration (Phase 2)
Priority focus on migrating components to modern TypeScript services:
- **High Traffic Components:** Automatic P1 priority
- **Active Development Areas:** P1 priority
- **Legacy Components:** P2 priority based on usage

### Migration Status
- **Phase 1:** ✅ Complete - Modern services implemented
- **Phase 2:** 🟡 In Progress - Component migration
- **Phase 3:** ⏳ Planned - Legacy cleanup
