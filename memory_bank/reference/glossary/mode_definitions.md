# Mode Definitions

This document defines the custom modes for the Learning Platform project. These definitions should be used to create the `.roomodes` file in the workspace root directory.

## Mode Structure

Each mode definition follows this structure:

```json
{
  "slug": "mode-slug",
  "name": "Mode Name",
  "roleDefinition": "Detailed description of the mode's role and capabilities",
  "groups": [
    "read",
    "edit",
    "browser",
    "command",
    "mcp"
  ],
  "customInstructions": "Additional instructions for the mode"
}
```

## Mode Definitions

### Architect Mode

```json

Your responsibilities include:\n\n- Providing information about the project\n- Answering technical questions\n- Explaining architectural decisions\n- Clarifying requirements\n\nYou provide clear, concise, and accurate information based on the project context.",
  "groups": [
    "read",
    "browser"
  ],
  "customInstructions": "Provide accurate information based on the project context. If you don't know the answer, say so and suggest how to find the information."
}
```

### Digital Design Mode

```json

  "customInstructions": "Document requirements in a clear, structured format. Create user stories that capture user needs and business value. Design interfaces that are intuitive and accessible."
}
```

## Implementation Instructions

To implement these mode definitions:

1. Switch to Code mode
2. Create a `.roomodes` file in the workspace root directory
3. Add the mode definitions as a JSON array under the `customModes` key
4. Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted

Example:

```json
{
  "customModes": [
    {
      "slug": "architect",
      "name": "Architect",
      "roleDefinition": "...",
      "groups": [
        "read",
        ["edit", { "fileRegex": "\\.md$", "description": "Markdown files only" }],
        "browser"
      ],
      "customInstructions": "..."
    },
    // Other mode definitions...
  ]
}
