# P1 - High Priority Tasks

> **ðŸ”¥ HIGH PRIORITY**: These tasks should be completed within the current sprint (1-2 weeks).

## Criteria for P1 Classification
- Core functionality needed for upcoming release
- Significant user experience degradation
- Performance issues affecting >20% of users
- Blocking other high-priority work
- Customer-facing feature with committed deadline

## P1 Sprint Planning Guidelines

### Capacity Allocation
- **Target**: 70-80% of sprint capacity for P1 tasks
- **Buffer**: 20-30% for P0 emergencies and P2 overflow
- **Rule**: Never commit to more P1 work than can be completed

### Task Selection Priority (within P1)
1. **Critical Bugs**: Fix user-blocking issues first
2. **Modern Service Migration**: Advance TASK-012 Phase 2 goals
3. **Performance Issues**: Address scalability and response time problems
4. **Feature Completion**: Finish half-completed features before starting new ones

### Dependencies Management
- **Prerequisite Tracking**: Ensure all dependencies are resolved before sprint
- **Parallel Work**: Identify tasks that can proceed in parallel
- **Risk Mitigation**: Have backup tasks ready if dependencies are delayed

## Learning Platform P1 Focus Areas

### User Experience Priorities
- **Student Journey**: Task submission, progress tracking, feedback receipt
- **Instructor Journey**: Course creation, task management, grading workflow
- **System Reliability**: Authentication, data integrity, performance

### Technical Architecture Priorities
- **Modern Service Adoption**: Continue TASK-012 Phase 2 migration
- **Performance Optimization**: Database queries, API response times
- **Security Hardening**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Code Quality**: Test coverage, technical debt reduction

### Business Value Priorities
- **Core Workflows**: Protect and enhance primary user journeys
- **Scalability**: Support growing user base and content volume
- **Reliability**: Minimize downtime and data loss risks
- **Feature Completeness**: Deliver committed functionality on time

## P1 Task Management

### Daily Standup Focus
- Review P1 progress and blockers
- Identify tasks at risk of missing sprint goals
- Reallocate resources to ensure P1 completion
- Escalate blockers immediately

### Weekly P1 Review
- Assess P1 completion rate vs. capacity planning
- Adjust future sprint capacity based on velocity
- Identify process improvements for P1 delivery
- Update P1 task estimates based on actual effort

### Sprint Commitment Rules
- **Over-commitment**: Remove P1 tasks before reducing quality
- **Under-commitment**: Add P2 tasks to fill remaining capacity
- **Mid-sprint Changes**: P0 tasks can displace P1 work with stakeholder approval

## P1 Quality Gates

### Definition of Ready Validation
- [ ] User story format followed
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined and testable
- [ ] Technical approach agreed upon
- [ ] Story points estimated
- [ ] Dependencies resolved
- [ ] Architecture impact assessed

### Definition of Done Enforcement
- [ ] All acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Performance requirements met
- [ ] Security requirements validated
- [ ] No regressions introduced

## Risk Management for P1 Tasks

### Common P1 Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Requirements expanding during development
- **Technical Complexity**: Underestimated implementation difficulty
- **Dependency Delays**: Prerequisite work taking longer than expected
- **Resource Conflicts**: Key developers unavailable or overcommitted

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Regular Check-ins**: Daily progress assessment for all P1 tasks
- **Early Warning System**: Flag tasks at risk 2-3 days before deadline
- **Backup Plans**: Identify alternative approaches for complex tasks
- **Resource Flexibility**: Cross-train team members on critical areas

## P1 Success Metrics

### Sprint-Level Metrics
- **P1 Completion Rate**: Target 95%+ of committed P1 tasks completed
- **Story Point Accuracy**: Actual effort within 20% of estimated
- **Cycle Time**: Average time from "In Progress" to "Done"
- **Defect Rate**: P1 tasks should introduce <5% defects

### Project-Level Metrics
- **Velocity Consistency**: P1 velocity should be predictable within Â±15%
- **User Impact**: P1 tasks should measurably improve user experience
- **Technical Debt**: P1 work should not increase technical debt
- **Team Satisfaction**: Team confidence in P1 commitments

**Note**: P1 tasks are the backbone of sprint commitments. Success here builds team credibility and user trust. When in doubt about priority, consider the user impact and business value.
