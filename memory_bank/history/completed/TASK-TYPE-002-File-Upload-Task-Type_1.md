# Task: Implement File Upload Task Type

## Task Metadata
- **Task-ID:** TASK-TYPE-002
- **Status:** DONE
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Dependencies:** TASK-SUBMISSION-001
- **Assigned To:** Architect
- **Started At:** 2025-02-26 21:23:39

- **Story Points:** 6

## Description
Implement a comprehensive file upload task type that allows students to submit assignments by uploading one or more files. This task type will support multiple file formats, size restrictions, and file preview functionality.

## Business Context
File uploads are essential for assignments that require students to submit documents, presentations, images, code files, or other digital artifacts. This task type enables instructors to collect and evaluate student work that cannot be adequately represented through text submissions alone, such as design projects, programming assignments, research papers, and multimedia presentations.

## Technical Context
- **System Architecture:** Django backend with React frontend
- **Related Components:**
  - LearningTask model (from TASK-MODEL-001)
  - Submission system (from TASK-SUBMISSION-001)
  - Task type registry system
  - File storage service
- **Technical Constraints:**
  - Must use the task type interface defined in the task types implementation guide
  - Must support secure file storage
  - Must implement virus scanning for uploaded files
  - Must handle large file uploads efficiently

## Requirements

### Inputs
- Task settings from instructor (allowed file types, size limits, number of files)
- Student file uploads
- Optional file descriptions

### Outputs
- Validated and stored file submissions
- Submission confirmation and receipt
- File preview (when possible)
- Validation feedback

### Functional Requirements
1. File Upload Interface
   - Drag-and-drop file upload area
   - Multiple file selection support
   - Upload progress indicators
   - File type and size validation
   - File preview functionality

2. File Management
   - Add/remove files before submission
   - Edit file descriptions
   - Replace uploaded files
   - View upload history

3. Instructor Configuration
   - Configurable allowed file types
   - Maximum file size settings
   - Maximum number of files setting
   - Option to require file descriptions
   - File naming requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Implement `FileUploadTaskType` class extending `BaseTaskType`
- Create React components for file upload interface
- Implement secure file storage with proper access controls
- Support virus scanning for uploaded files
- Implement file type and size validation

## Implementation Details

### Required Libraries and Versions
- Frontend:
  - React 18.0+
  - react-dropzone 14.0.0+ for drag-and-drop uploads
  - axios 1.0.0+ for file upload handling
- Backend:
  - Django 4.2+
  - django-storages 1.12.0+ for file storage
  - django-virus-scan 0.4.0+ for virus scanning
  - Pillow 9.0.0+ for image processing

## Validation Criteria
- [x] File upload interface supports drag-and-drop
- [x] File type and size validation works correctly
- [x] Multiple file uploads are properly handled
- [x] File previews are generated when possible
- [x] Virus scanning is implemented for all uploads

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Students can upload files of allowed types and sizes
2. File validation prevents invalid uploads with clear error messages
3. File previews are available for supported file types
4. Instructors can download and view submitted files
5. File descriptions are properly stored and displayed

## Estimated Effort
- Frontend Implementation: 2 story points
- Backend Implementation: 3 story points
- Testing and Security: 1 story point
- Total: 6 story points

## Potential Risks
- Security vulnerabilities in file handling
- Performance issues with large files
- Storage capacity management
- Browser compatibility issues with file upload interface
