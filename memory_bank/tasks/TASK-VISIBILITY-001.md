## Task Metadata

- **Task-ID:** TASK-VISIBILITY-001
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** High
- **Dependencies:** TASK-EDIT-001

## Description

Implement a comprehensive visibility and status management system for learning tasks.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Visibility Levels
   - Draft: Visible only to instructors
   - Published: Visible to students
   - Archived: Hidden from active view

2. Status Change Management
   - Implement workflow for status transitions
   - Enforce permission-based status updates
   - Track status change history

3. Visibility Controls
   - Filter tasks based on visibility level
   - Provide clear UI indicators for task status
   - Implement role-based visibility rules

### Technical Requirements

- Frontend: Create status management UI
- Backend: Implement visibility and status logic
- Database: Add visibility and status tracking fields

## Validation Criteria

- [x] Instructors can update task status
- [x] Students see only Published tasks
- [x] Status change history is recorded
- [x] Visibility rules are consistently applied

## Implementation Notes

- Use enum for task visibility states
- Create audit log for status changes
- Implement permission checks for status updates

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tasks have clear visibility states
2. Status changes are tracked
3. Visibility rules work as expected
4. Unauthorized status changes are blocked

## Estimated Effort

- Frontend: 3 story points
- Backend: 4 story points
- Total: 7 story points

## Potential Risks

- Complexity of status transition rules
- Ensuring consistent visibility across platforms
