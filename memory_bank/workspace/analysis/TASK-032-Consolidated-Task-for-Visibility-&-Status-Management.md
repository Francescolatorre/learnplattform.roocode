## Task Metadata

- **Task-ID:** TASK-032
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** High
- **Dependencies:**
  - TASK-031: Implement Reusable Components for Task Management
  - TASK-030: Task Management UI Enhancements

## Description

This task consolidates the objectives of TASK-013 and TASK-VISIBILITY-001 into a unified effort to implement both UI and backend functionality for task visibility and status management. It includes advanced UI features, reusable components, and backend logic to ensure seamless integration and functionality.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Visibility Levels
   - Draft: Visible only to instructors
   - Published: Visible to students
   - Archived: Hidden from active view

2. Status Change Management
   - Implement workflow for status transitions
   - Enforce permission-based status updates
   - Track status change history

3. Visibility Controls
   - Filter tasks based on visibility level
   - Provide clear UI indicators for task status
   - Implement role-based visibility rules

4. Advanced UI Features
   - Sorting and filtering capabilities
   - Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Technical Requirements

- Frontend: Create status management UI and integrate reusable components from TASK-031.
- Backend: Implement visibility and status logic.
- Database: Add visibility and status tracking fields.

## Validation Criteria

- [x] Instructors can update task status
- [x] Students see only Published tasks
- [x] Status change history is recorded
- [x] Visibility rules are consistently applied
- [x] UI is intuitive, accessible, and responsive

## Implementation Notes

- Use enum for task visibility states
- Create audit log for status changes
- Implement permission checks for status updates
- Leverage reusable components from TASK-031

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Tasks have clear visibility states
2. Status changes are tracked
3. Visibility rules work as expected
4. Unauthorized status changes are blocked
5. UI meets accessibility and usability standards

## Estimated Effort

- Frontend: 5 story points
- Backend: 5 story points
- Total: 10 story points

## Potential Risks

- Complexity of status transition rules
- Ensuring consistent visibility across platforms
- Coordination between frontend and backend teams
