# Husky Pre-commit Hook Setup ✅

## Current Configuration

The project now has automated pre-commit hooks set up with Husky and lint-staged:

### 📦 Package Dependencies
- ✅ `husky: ^9.1.7` - Git hooks manager
- ✅ `lint-staged: ^16.1.6` - Run linters on staged files

### 🔧 Configuration in `frontend/package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ],
    "*.{json,md,css,scss}": [
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
}
```

### 🪝 Pre-commit Hook: `.husky/pre-commit`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh

# Pre-commit hook to automatically fix import order and formatting issues
echo "🔍 Running pre-commit checks..."

cd frontend

echo "📦 Checking staged files..."
if git diff --staged --name-only | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$' > /dev/null; then
  echo "🔧 Running ESLint with auto-fix on staged files..."
  npx lint-staged

  # Add any files that were auto-fixed
  git add -u

  echo "✅ Pre-commit checks completed!"
else
  echo "ℹ️  No TypeScript/JavaScript files staged"
fi
```

## How It Works

### 🚀 Automatic Import Order Fixing

When you commit files, the pre-commit hook will automatically:

1. **Run ESLint with `--fix`** on all staged TypeScript/JavaScript files
2. **Fix import order violations** according to the project's ESLint rules
3. **Format code with Prettier**
4. **Re-stage the fixed files**

### 📋 Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make changes to files with import order issues
git add src/components/MyComponent.tsx

# 2. Commit (pre-commit hook runs automatically)
git commit -m "Add new component"

# 🔧 Hook runs:
# - Fixes import order in MyComponent.tsx
# - Formats code with Prettier
# - Re-stages the fixed file
# - Continues with commit

# 3. Changes are committed with proper import order ✅
```

## Benefits

✅ **Prevents CI Pipeline Failures**: Import order issues are fixed before they reach CI
✅ **Zero Manual Work**: No need to remember to run `npm run lint -- --fix`
✅ **Consistent Code**: All committed code follows project standards
✅ **Team Productivity**: No more "fix linting" commits

## Manual Commands

If you need to run these tools manually:

```bash
# Fix import order in all files
cd frontend && npm run lint -- --fix

# Run lint-staged on current changes
cd frontend && npx lint-staged

# Run on specific file
cd frontend && npx eslint src/path/to/file.ts --fix
```

## Testing the Hook

To test the pre-commit hook:

1. Make a change to a TypeScript file with import order issues
2. Stage the file: `git add filename.ts`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "test commit"`
4. Watch the hook automatically fix import order! 🎉

The pre-commit hook is now active and will prevent import order violations from ever reaching the CI pipeline again.
