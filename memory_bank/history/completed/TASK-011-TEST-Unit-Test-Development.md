## Description

Develop a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the learning task features. This includes testing the creation, editing, visibility settings, submission, grading, and progress tracking functionalities.

## Business Context

Comprehensive unit testing is essential for:

- Ensuring system reliability and stability
- Reducing regression issues
- Facilitating safe code changes
- Documenting expected behavior
- Supporting continuous integration

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Test Coverage
   - Create tests for all core functionalities
   - Cover edge cases and error scenarios
   - Test data validation
   - Verify business rules
   - Test integration points

2. Testing Framework
   - Use project's standard testing framework
   - Implement test helpers and utilities
   - Set up test data fixtures
   - Configure test environment

### Technical Requirements

- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Fast test execution
- Isolated test environment
- Clear test organization
- Maintainable test code

## Validation Criteria

- [x] All tests pass consistently
- [x] Coverage meets minimum requirements
- [x] Edge cases are covered
- [x] Error scenarios handled
- [x] CI/CD integration works

## Implementation

- Write unit tests for each feature
- Create test utilities and helpers
- Set up test data factories
- Implement mock services
- Configure test environment
- Document testing patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All unit tests pass without errors
2. Code coverage meets or exceeds 80%
3. Tests are properly documented
4. CI pipeline integration works
5. Test reports are clear and useful

## Estimated Effort

- Test Implementation: 5 story points
- Test Infrastructure: 2 story points
- Documentation: 1 story point
- Total: 8 story points

## Potential Risks

- Complex test scenarios
- Test environment issues
- Integration challenges
- Performance impact
- Maintenance overhead

## Documentation

- Test suite organization
- Test patterns and practices
- Mock service setup
- CI/CD integration
- Test coverage reports

## Risk Assessment

- Risk: Flaky Tests
  - Impact: High
  - Probability: Medium
  - Mitigation: Implement retry mechanisms, improve test isolation
- Risk: Performance Impact
  - Impact: Medium
  - Probability: Low
  - Mitigation: Optimize test execution, parallelize when possible
