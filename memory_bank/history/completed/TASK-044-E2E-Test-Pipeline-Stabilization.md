## Business Context

**CRITICAL BUSINESS IMPACT:** E2E test failures are blocking deployment pipeline and preventing reliable releases. Current test suite exhibits:
- Inconsistent failures in CI/CD pipeline (19+ minute runtime with failures)
- Authentication flow instabilities causing cascading test failures
- Local development friction due to configuration mismatches
- **BUSINESS RISK:** Cannot guarantee feature quality or regression prevention

**ROI Justification:** Stable E2E testing enables faster development cycles, reduces hotfix deployments, and ensures production reliability.

## Current State Analysis (PMO Assessment)

### Issues Identified in Recent Pipeline Run
Based on logs from `/temp/e2elogs.log` and pipeline analysis:

1. **Authentication Flow Failures** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - Network timeout issues in LoginPage.setupNetworkListeners
   - Token verification failures after apparent login success
   - Logout button selector mismatches with Material-UI components

2. **Configuration Drift** (HIGH IMPACT)
   - Environment variable inconsistencies between local/CI
   - Port mismatches (dev:5173, CI:3000, API:8000)
   - Playwright configuration not optimized for current architecture

3. **Test Architecture Issues** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
   - Test interdependencies causing cascading failures
   - Insufficient error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Performance bottlenecks in parallel execution

---

## Requirements (DRAFT - REFINEMENT NEEDED)

### **REFINEMENT REQUIRED:** This section needs detailed technical analysis

#### Primary Objectives (To be refined)
1. **Pipeline Reliability**
   - Achieve <5% flaky test rate in CI
   - Reduce E2E runtime to <10 minutes
   - Enable parallel test execution without conflicts

2. **Local Development Support**
   - One-command E2E test execution locally
   - Consistent behavior between local and CI environments
   - Clear debugging capabilities for failed tests

3. **Test Maintainability**
   - Eliminate test interdependencies
   - Improve test isolation and cleanup
   - Standardize page object patterns

### User Stories (DRAFT)

```gherkin
Feature: Stable E2E Testing

  Scenario: Developer runs E2E tests locally
    Given I have the development environment set up
    When I run "npm run test:e2e"
    Then all tests execute without environment-related failures
    And I get clear feedback on any legitimate test failures
    And tests complete in under 10 minutes

  Scenario: CI pipeline executes E2E tests
    Given code is pushed to main branch
    When the E2E test workflow runs
    Then tests complete successfully with <5% flaky rate
    And test results are clearly reported
    And pipeline proceeds to deployment stage

  Scenario: Test failure diagnosis
    Given an E2E test fails
    When I review the test output
    Then I can clearly identify the root cause
    And I have sufficient debugging information
    And Screenshots/videos are available for UI issues
```

## Technical Scope (REQUIRES REFINEMENT)

### **ATTENTION:** Detailed technical analysis needed during refinement

#### Areas Requiring Investigation
1. **Authentication & Session Management**
   - Review login flow reliability
   - Standardize token handling across tests
   - Implement robust session cleanup

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Audit all environment variables usage
   - Standardize configuration across environments
   - Document configuration dependencies

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Review Playwright configuration optimization
   - Assess test parallelization strategy
   - Evaluate test data management approach

4. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Implement test retry strategies
   - Add comprehensive error logging
   - Create test stability monitoring

---

## PMO REFINEMENT REQUIREMENTS

### **MANDATORY BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION:**

1. **Technical Deep Dive Session** (2-4 hours)
   - Detailed analysis of current test failures
   - Architecture review with technical leads
   - Performance bottleneck identification

2. **Solution Architecture Design**
   - Define target test architecture
   - Create implementation roadmap
   - Identify breaking changes and migration strategy

3. **Resource & Timeline Planning**
   - Accurate effort estimation post-analysis
   - Resource allocation and skill requirements
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

4. **Success Metrics Definition**
   - Quantifiable stability targets
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Quality gates for completion

## Preliminary Success Criteria (DRAFT)

### **WARNING:** These criteria need validation during refinement

#### Pipeline Metrics
- [ ] E2E test success rate >95% over 20 consecutive runs
- [ ] Average E2E runtime <10 minutes in CI
- [ ] Zero environment-related test failures
- [ ] Test flakiness rate <5%

#### Developer Experience
- [ ] One-command local E2E execution
- [ ] Consistent results between local and CI
- [ ] Clear error messages and debugging info
- [ ] Complete test documentation

#### Technical Quality
- [ ] Zero test interdependencies

## RISK ASSESSMENT (PMO)

### HIGH RISKS
- **Test instability during refactoring** - Could break existing working tests
- **Configuration complexity** - Multiple environment variables to manage
- **Resource allocation** - May require significant developer time

### MITIGATION STRATEGIES
- Implement changes incrementally with rollback capability
- Maintain staging environment for test validation
- Document all configuration changes thoroughly

## REFINEMENT CHECKLIST

**BEFORE MOVING TO READY STATUS:**

- [ ] Technical analysis session completed
- [ ] Root cause analysis of current failures documented
- [ ] Solution architecture approved by tech leads

## Notes

**PMO DIRECTIVE:** This task is BLOCKED for implementation until proper refinement is completed. The complexity and business impact require thorough analysis before proceeding.

**Previous Related Work:** 
- Recent E2E fixes in PR #28 improved performance but did not achieve full stability
- Configuration improvements made but further optimization needed

**Business Stakeholder Communication Required:** QA Manager and DevOps Lead must approve final scope and timeline before implementation begins.
