   - Chosen for its maturity, scalability, and extensive ecosystem.
   - Supports rapid development with built-in features and a strong community.

2. **Django REST Framework**
   - Provides a powerful toolkit for building web APIs.
   - Facilitates serialization, authentication, and viewsets for RESTful design.

3. **PostgreSQL 15+**
   - Selected for its reliability, performance, and advanced features.
   - Supports complex queries and large datasets efficiently.

### Frontend Technologies

1. **React 18**
   - Offers a component-based architecture for building dynamic UIs.
   - Ensures high performance with concurrent rendering capabilities.

2. **Material UI**
   - Provides a comprehensive library of UI components for consistent design.
   - Supports responsive design and accessibility standards.

3. **Vite Build Tool**
   - Chosen for its fast build times and modern development experience.
   - Supports hot module replacement and optimized bundling.

### State Management

1. **React Hooks & Context API**
   - Enables efficient state management within React components.
   - Provides a simple and flexible approach to managing global state.

### Testing Frameworks

1. **Jest & React Testing Library**
   - Facilitates unit and integration testing for React components.
   - Ensures reliable and maintainable test suites.

### DevOps & Infrastructure

1. **Docker & GitHub Actions**
   - Supports containerization for consistent development environments.
   - Automates CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The chosen technologies provide a scalable and maintainable architecture.
- Facilitates rapid development and deployment with modern tools.
