# TASK-049: Migrate TaskStore to Modern Service Integration

**Priority**: High
**Type**: INFRASTRUCTURE - Store Migration
**Parent Task**: TASK-027-B (Modern Service State Integration)
**Dependencies**: TASK-027-B (Service Integration Patterns)
**Created**: 2025-09-15

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Migrate the legacy TaskStore (Zustand) to use modern service integration patterns established in TASK-027-B. This implements Phase 2 of the modern service migration strategy, applying the proven service-store integration patterns to the task management store.

---

## BUSINESS CONTEXT

The TaskStore is a critical component for task management functionality used by both instructors and students. Migrating to modern service integration will:
- Improve performance through intelligent caching
- Provide consistent error handling across task operations
- Enable type-safe service-store interactions
- Establish reusable patterns for remaining store migrations

---

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### **Store Integration**
- [ ] Integrate `modernLearningTaskService` with TaskStore using established patterns
- [ ] Implement service-aware store middleware from TASK-027-B
- [ ] Create typed store hooks for task operations (CRUD, filtering, pagination)
- [ ] Establish caching strategies for task data

### **Modern Service Adoption**
- [ ] Replace legacy service calls with `modernLearningTaskService`
- [ ] Implement error handling patterns with `withManagedExceptions`
- [ ] Add loading state management using service integration utilities
- [ ] Create optimistic update patterns for better UX

### **Type Safety & Performance**
- [ ] Ensure type safety across service-store boundaries
- [ ] Implement intelligent caching with configurable TTL
- [ ] Add API call deduplication for task operations
- [ ] Optimize store selectors for performance

---

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### **Integration Success**
- [ ] All TaskStore actions use modern service patterns
- [ ] Zero regression in existing task management functionality
- [ ] Improved data fetching performance (30%+ reduction in duplicate calls)
- [ ] Consistent error handling across all task operations

### **Developer Experience**
- [ ] Type-safe store hooks for all task service calls
- [ ] Simplified data fetching patterns for task components
- [ ] Clear error boundaries and recovery patterns
- [ ] Reusable integration patterns documented

### **Performance Metrics**
- [ ] Reduced memory usage in task state management
- [ ] Faster task list rendering and updates
- [ ] Improved cache hit rates for task data
- [ ] Better loading state coordination

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### **Phase 1: Core Migration (3 hours)**
1. Apply service integration patterns from TASK-027-B to TaskStore
2. Replace legacy service calls with `modernLearningTaskService`
3. Implement caching and error handling patterns
4. Create typed hooks for task operations

### **Phase 2: Enhancement (2 hours)**
1. Add optimistic updates for task creation/editing
2. Implement advanced caching strategies
3. Add performance monitoring and metrics
4. Update task-related components to use new patterns

### **Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (1 hour)**
1. Update test suite for modern service integration
2. Add performance tests and validation
3. Document migration patterns for team adoption
4. Create component usage examples

---

## MIGRATION STRATEGY

### **Current State (Legacy)**
```typescript
// TaskStore with legacy service calls
const useTaskStore = create((set, get) => ({
  tasks: [],
  loading: false,
  error: null,

  fetchTasks: async () => {
    set({ loading: true });
    try {
      const tasks = await legacyTaskService.getTasks();
      set({ tasks, loading: false });
    } catch (error) {
      set({ error, loading: false });
    }
  }
}));
```

### **Target State (Modern)**
```typescript
// TaskStore with modern service integration
const useTaskStore = create((set, get) => ({
  ...createServiceIntegration(modernLearningTaskService),

  // Enhanced with caching, error handling, and type safety
  fetchTasks: createAsyncOperation('tasks', (options) =>
    modernLearningTaskService.getTasks(options)
  ),
}));

// Type-safe hooks
const useTaskOperations = () => createCrudHooks(useTaskStore, modernLearningTaskService);
```

## DEPENDENCIES & BLOCKERS

### **DEPENDENCIES**
- **TASK-027-B**: Modern Service State Integration (COMPLETED)
- **modernLearningTaskService**: Available and tested

### **POTENTIAL BLOCKERS**
- Complex task state management requiring careful migration
- Multiple components dependent on TaskStore patterns
- Integration testing complexity

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### **MEDIUM RISK**
- TaskStore is widely used across the application
- Multiple component dependencies require coordination
- Performance optimization requires careful implementation

### **MITIGATION STRATEGIES**
- Incremental migration using proven TASK-027-B patterns
- Comprehensive testing at each migration step
- Backward compatibility during transition period

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### **BEFORE (Current State)**
- Legacy service integration with basic error handling
- Standard loading patterns without caching
- Basic task state management

### **AFTER (Target State)**
- Modern service integration with intelligent caching
- Enhanced error handling with user-friendly recovery
- Optimized performance with reduced API calls
