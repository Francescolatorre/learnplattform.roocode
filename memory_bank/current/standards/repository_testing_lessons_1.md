# Repository Testing Lessons Learned

## Key Learnings

### 1. Factory Boy Patterns

#### Issues Encountered

- Default task creation in QuizFactory caused test failures
- Missing graded_by field in SubmissionFactory
- Factory post-generation hooks needed better handling

#### Recommendations

1. Always explicitly handle optional relationships:

```python
@factory.post_generation
def tasks(self, create, extracted, **kwargs):
    if not create:
        return
    if extracted is not None:  # Check for None, not truthiness
        self.tasks.add(*extracted)
```

2. Include all model fields in factories:
   - Add fields even if they're nullable
   - Document field dependencies
   - Set sensible defaults

### 2. Foreign Key Relationships

#### Issues Encountered

- Passing IDs instead of model instances
- Incorrect relationship handling in tests
- Missing cascade delete tests

#### Recommendations

1. Always use model instances for foreign keys:

```python
# Wrong
submission.graded_by = admin_user.id

# Correct
submission.graded_by = admin_user
```

2. Test relationship constraints:
   - Cascade deletion behavior
   - Null handling
   - Unique constraints

### 3. Transaction Handling

#### Issues Encountered

- Inconsistent transaction usage
- Missing isolation level tests
- Incomplete rollback scenarios

#### Recommendations

1. Use proper transaction fixtures:

```python
@pytest.fixture
def test_transaction():
    with transaction.atomic():
        sid = transaction.savepoint()
        yield
        transaction.savepoint_rollback(sid)
```

2. Test all transaction scenarios:
   - Atomic operations
   - Nested transactions
   - Rollbacks
   - Concurrent access

### 4. Test Organization

#### Best Practices

1. Group tests by operation type:
   - CRUD operations
   - Query methods
   - Transaction tests
   - Error cases

2. Follow consistent naming:

```python
def test_<operation>_<scenario>():
    # Example: test_create_user_with_valid_data()
```

3. Use clear test documentation:

```python
def test_method():
    """
    Test description with:
    - Preconditions
    - Expected behavior
    - Edge cases covered
    """
```

### 5. Coverage Considerations

#### Recommendations

1. Separate coverage metrics:
   - Core repository operations (aim for 100%)
   - Error handling (aim for 100%)
   - Helper methods (aim for 80%+)

2. Use targeted coverage reporting:

```bash
pytest --cov=core/repositories/ --cov-report=html
```

## Process Improvements

### 1. Test First Development

- Write test cases before implementation
- Define clear test scenarios in documentation
- Review test coverage requirements early

### 2. Code Review Guidelines

- Check for proper factory usage
- Verify transaction handling
- Ensure relationship handling
- Review test naming and organization

### 3. Documentation Updates

- Maintain factory documentation
- Document common testing patterns
- Keep test README files updated
- Include example test cases

## Action Items

1. Update Repository Test Documentation:
   - Add Factory Boy best practices
   - Include relationship handling examples
   - Document transaction patterns

2. Create Testing Templates:
   - Standard test class structure
   - Common test scenarios
   - Factory definitions

3. Update Code Review Checklist:
   - Factory implementation review
   - Transaction handling verification
   - Relationship testing coverage

4. Knowledge Sharing:
   - Schedule team review of testing patterns
   - Create testing pattern documentation
   - Regular test coverage reviews

## Future Considerations

1. Test Infrastructure:
   - Consider test data management tools
   - Evaluate test isolation strategies
   - Plan for performance testing

2. Automation:
   - Add pre-commit hooks for test coverage
   - Automate test pattern verification
   - Implement test documentation checks

3. Monitoring:
   - Track test coverage trends
   - Monitor test execution times
   - Report common test failures

These learnings should be incorporated into the team's development process and regularly reviewed for continued improvement.
