## Test Infrastructure Debugging - Tasks App (2025-02-28)

### Problem Identified
- Intermittent test discovery and execution failures in the tasks app
- Pytest and Django test configuration issues

### Root Causes
1. Inconsistent test file naming and import conventions
2. Potential caching conflicts in Python's import system
3. Misalignment between Django and pytest test discovery mechanisms

### Resolution Strategies
- Renamed test file to follow pytest naming conventions (test_models.py)
- Rewrote tests using pytest decorators and assertions
- Cleaned up __pycache__ directories
- Verified Django and pytest configuration

### Key Learnings
- Importance of consistent test file naming (test_*.py)
- Using pytest decorators like @pytest.mark.django_db
- Cleaning __pycache__ directories to resolve import conflicts
- Verifying test environment configuration before debugging

### Test Outcomes
- 3 tests successfully implemented and passed
- Covered key functionality:
  1. Learning task creation
  2. Task status choices validation
  3. Task difficulty choices validation

### Recommendations
- Maintain consistent test file naming across the project
- Use pytest for more precise test discovery and execution
- Regularly clean __pycache__ directories
- Implement similar testing approach for other app models

### Status
- Tasks app test infrastructure: RESOLVED
- Confidence in test coverage: HIGH
