# TASK-031: UI Components Development

## Task Metadata

- **Task-ID:** TASK-031
- **Status:** TODO
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Effort:** 5 story points

## Requirements

- Develop stateless UI components using Material UI.
- Ensure components receive data through props and maintain independence from global state.

## Detailed List of Components

- **Buttons**: Standardized buttons for form submissions, navigation, and actions.
  - **Use Cases**: Submit forms, trigger modals, navigate between pages.
  - **Integration Points**: Used in `TASK-013` for task management actions and `TASK-030` for UI enhancements.
- **Modals**: Reusable modal dialogs for confirmations, alerts, and forms.
  - **Use Cases**: Display confirmation dialogs, show detailed forms.
  - **Integration Points**: Incorporated in `TASK-013` for task creation/editing and `TASK-030` for enhanced user interactions.
- **Dropdowns**: Customizable dropdown menus for selections and filters.
  - **Use Cases**: Filter tasks, select options in forms.
  - **Integration Points**: Utilized in `TASK-013` for task filtering and `TASK-030` for improved navigation.

## Integration Points

- **TASK-032**: Components will be used to design the consolidated Task Management UI, ensuring consistency and reusability.
- **TASK-030**: Enhancements to the UI will leverage these components for a cohesive user experience.
- **Dependencies**: Shared functionality such as state management and event handling will be coordinated between tasks.

## Shared Repository

- **Repository Structure**:
  - **Components**: Organized by type (e.g., buttons, modals, dropdowns).
  - **Styles**: Centralized styling for consistency.
  - **Utilities**: Shared helper functions for component logic.
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to track changes and maintain compatibility.
- **Collaboration Guidelines**:
  - Use pull requests for all changes.
  - Conduct code reviews to ensure quality.
  - Maintain comprehensive documentation for each component.

## Validation Criteria

- Components should render correctly and be reusable across different parts of the application.
- Components should adhere to the design specifications provided.

## Dependencies

- FRONTEND_SETUP: Initial setup of the frontend environment.

## Expected Outcome

- A library of reusable UI components that enhances the user interface and user experience of the application.
