# TASK-001: Implement User Progress Tracking Models

## Status: DONE

## Implementation Details

The User Progress Tracking Models have been successfully implemented according to the requirements. The implementation includes:

1. **Core Models**:
   - CourseEnrollment: Tracks student enrollment in courses
   - TaskProgress: Tracks progress on individual learning tasks
   - QuizAttempt: Tracks quiz attempts by students
   - QuizResponse: Stores student responses to individual quiz questions

2. **Helper Methods**:
   - calculate_progress_percentage: Calculates overall progress percentages
   - is_course_completed: Determines if a course is completed
   - get_latest_quiz_attempt: Retrieves latest quiz attempts

3. **Database Migrations**:
   - Created migration file: `0002_quizattempt_taskprogress_quizresponse_and_more.py`
   - Successfully applied migration to the database

4. **API Serializers**:
   - CourseEnrollmentSerializer
   - TaskProgressSerializer
   - QuizAttemptSerializer
   - QuizResponseSerializer
   - NestedQuizAttemptSerializer (for use in other serializers)

5. **API ViewSets**:
   - CourseEnrollmentViewSet
   - TaskProgressViewSet
   - QuizAttemptViewSet
   - QuizResponseViewSet

6. **Tests**:
   - Comprehensive unit tests for all models and methods
   - Test coverage exceeds the required 85%

7. **Documentation**:
   - Created detailed documentation in `core/docs/progress_tracking_models.md`
   - Created ADR in `memory_bank/ADRs/ADR-001-User-Progress-Tracking-Models.md`

## Validation

All validation criteria have been met:

1. ✅ All required models are implemented with appropriate fields and relationships
2. ✅ Database migrations successfully apply to existing database
3. ✅ Models include all specified helper methods and features
4. ✅ Unit tests coverage for all new models and methods (all tests passing)
5. ✅ Documentation updated to reflect new data model
6. ✅ Serializers correctly represent model data for API responses

## Next Steps

The data models for progress tracking are now in place. Subsequent tasks should focus on:

1. Implementing frontend components to display progress information
2. Creating more advanced analytics based on the collected data
3. Implementing notifications for progress milestones
4. Adding gamification features based on progress tracking

## Notes

The implementation follows Django best practices and maintains backward compatibility with existing data. The API endpoints are secured with appropriate permissions to ensure that users can only access their own progress data unless they have admin privileges.
