### [2025-06-13 07:51 CEST] [TASK UPDATE] [TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001]

- Set as HIGH PRIORITY task in activeContext.md
- Migration plan created and validated
- Implementation ready to begin with phased approach:
  1. Core API Service updates
  2. Template service validation
  3. Service migration (enrollmentService, progressService)
- All requirements and validation criteria documented
- Next step: Begin Phase 1 implementation

### [2025-04-12 14:45 CEST] [VALIDATED] [TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001]

- Architect Mode has validated the requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria for the TypeScript Services Standardization Initiative.
- The standard is clear, comprehensive, and aligned with project goals and governance.
- Risks and mitigation strategies are documented.
- The initiative is ready for adoption and rollout. Next step: proceed with standardization planning and implementation.

### [2025-04-12 14:44 CEST] [ARCHITECT MODE SESSION START]

- Orchestrator: Architect Mode
- Session Intent: Review and validate the TypeScript Services Standardization Initiative (TYPESCRIPT-SERVICES-STANDARDIZATION-001) for completeness, clarity, risks, and alignment. If validated, update status to VALIDATED and document next steps.

### [2025-04-12 16:03 CEST] [CODE MODE SESSION START]

- Orchestrator: Code Mode
- Session Intent: Fix all TypeScript (tsc) errors in the frontend and document all actions as per governance.

### [2025-04-12 16:03 CEST] [DELEGATION]

- Code Mode taking ownership of tsc error resolution for the frontend. Subtask status: IN_PROGRESS

### [2025-04-12 16:54 CEST] [CODE MODE SESSION START]

#### [2025-04-12 16:56 CEST] [INTEGRATION/API-LEVEL TEST AUDIT]

### [2025-04-12 16:57 CEST] [CODE MODE SESSION COMPLETE]

- Orchestrator: Code Mode
- Session Outcome: All delegated audits (unit test coverage, integration/API-level tests, linting/formatting) completed and findings logged.
- Status Update: Subtasks remain IN_PROGRESS or BLOCKED pending test and config improvements. See above for details and next steps.

#### [2025-04-12 16:57 CEST] [LINTING/FORMATTING AUDIT]

- Audit Result: Linting could not be completed due to ESLint configuration error: "@typescript-eslint/require-jsdoc" rule not found in plugin "@typescript-eslint".
- No linting/formatting compliance can be confirmed until this is resolved.
- Next steps: Fix the ESLint configuration (remove or replace the missing rule), then rerun lint and format scripts to verify compliance for all TypeScript service modules.
- Subtask status: BLOCKED (awaiting ESLint config fix)

#### [2025-04-12 16:55 CEST] [UNIT TEST COVERAGE AUDIT]

- Audit Result: Unit test coverage for TypeScript service modules is insufficient. No module meets the ≥80% threshold.
- Coverage summary:
  - src/services/api/apiConfig.ts: 13.33%
  - src/services/api/apiService.ts: 0%
  - src/services/api/axiosConfig.ts: 0%
  - src/services/auth/authService.ts: 0%
  - src/services/resources/courseService.ts: 46.42%
  - src/services/resources/enrollmentService.ts: 0%
  - src/services/resources/learningTaskService.ts: 44.44%
  - src/services/resources/progressService.ts: 0%
- Next steps: Add or improve unit tests for all service modules to achieve ≥80% coverage as required by ADR-013 and governance.
- Subtask status: IN_PROGRESS (awaiting test implementation)

### [2025-04-12 18:40 CEST] [CODE MODE SESSION START]

- Orchestrator: Code Mode
- Session Intent: Set all open tasks to TODO at user request, deferring all in-progress and postponed work for later.
- Actions: Updated memory_bank/project_status.md and memory_bank/activeContext.md, moving all IN_PROGRESS and POSTPONED tasks to TODO. No tasks remain in progress or postponed; all open tasks are now TODO.
- Rationale: User requested to defer all open tasks for later, ensuring a clean slate for future prioritization.

### [2025-04-12 18:44 CEST] [ORCHESTRATION REVIEW LOG]

- Orchestrator: Code Mode (via Boomerang Mode delegation)
- Session Intent: Review unfinished tasks in the Orchestration Session Log and document their current status per latest governance action.
- Findings: All previously IN_PROGRESS or BLOCKED subtasks have been deferred and set to TODO as of 2025-04-12 18:40 CEST.
- There are currently no active IN_PROGRESS or POSTPONED tasks; all open tasks are now TODO.
- Rationale: This ensures a clean slate for future prioritization and aligns all task tracking files with the current project state.
- Status: DONE
