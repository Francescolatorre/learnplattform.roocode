## Description

Develop a comprehensive set of unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the learning task features. This includes testing the creation, editing, visibility settings, submission, grading, and progress tracking functionalities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- All unit tests must pass without errors.
- Code coverage must be at least 80% for the learning task features.
- Tests must be written using the testing framework specified in the project guidelines.

## Dependencies

- TASK-CREATION-001
- TASK-EDIT-001
- TASK-VISIBILITY-001
- TASK-SUBMISSION-001
- TASK-GRADING-001
- TASK-PROGRESS-001

## Implementation Steps

1. Identify the key functionalities to be tested.
2. Write unit tests for each functionality.
3. Ensure tests cover edge cases and typical usage scenarios.
4. Run tests and address any failures.
5. Validate code coverage and adjust tests as necessary.
6. Document the testing process and results.

## Notes

- Refer to the project's testing guidelines for best practices.
- Ensure tests are isolated and do not rely on external services.
