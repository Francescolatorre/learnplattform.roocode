## Quality Gates

### Pre-Development Gate
Task cannot enter "In Progress" status until Definition of Ready is met.
- **Gatekeeper:** Technical Lead or Senior Developer
- **Review Process:** 15-minute review session
- **Documentation:** DoR checklist completed and signed off

### Pre-Review Gate
Task cannot enter "In Review" status until development is complete.
- **Gatekeeper:** Developer self-assessment
- **Review Process:** Developer completes DoD checklist
- **Documentation:** All DoD items checked and verified

### Pre-Deployment Gate
Task cannot be marked "Done" until all quality criteria met.
- **Gatekeeper:** Product Owner and Technical Lead
- **Review Process:** Final acceptance review
- **Documentation:** Stakeholder sign-off recorded

## Escalation Process

### DoR Issues
If a task doesn't meet Definition of Ready:
1. **Return to Backlog:** Move back to appropriate priority folder
2. **Document Gaps:** List specific DoR items not met
3. **Assign Owner:** Product owner or business analyst to complete
4. **Timeline:** Must be resolved before next sprint planning

### DoD Issues
If a task cannot meet Definition of Done:
1. **Scope Assessment:** Determine if scope needs adjustment
2. **Quality Decision:** Never compromise on quality standards
3. **Timeline Impact:** Assess sprint commitment impact
4. **Stakeholder Communication:** Notify product owner immediately

### Exception Process
In rare cases where DoR/DoD exceptions are needed:
- **Business Justification:** Clear business case for exception
- **Risk Assessment:** Document additional risks created
- **Mitigation Plan:** Specific plan for addressing quality gaps
- **Approval Required:** Product owner and technical lead approval
- **Follow-up Task:** Create task to address quality gaps
