## Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is considered complete when it meets ALL of the following criteria:

### 1. Code Quality
- [ ] **Code Review**: At least one team member has reviewed and approved the code
- [ ] **Coding Standards**: Code follows project style guide and TypeScript best practices
- [ ] **No Code Smells**: SonarQube or similar tool shows acceptable quality metrics
- [ ] **Security**: No security vulnerabilities introduced (checked via static analysis)

### 2. Testing Requirements
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: New code has appropriate unit test coverage (>80%)
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: API endpoints tested with realistic data scenarios
- [ ] **Component Tests**: React components tested with proper mocking
- [ ] **Regression Tests**: Existing functionality not broken by changes

### 3. Functionality Verification
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: All defined acceptance criteria validated
- [ ] **Manual Testing**: Feature manually tested in development environment
- [ ] **Cross-Browser Testing**: Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari (for UI changes)
- [ ] **Mobile Responsiveness**: UI tested on mobile devices (for UI changes)

### 4. Documentation and Communication
- [ ] **Code Documentation**: Complex logic documented with JSDoc/TSDoc comments
- [ ] **API Documentation**: New/changed endpoints documented in OpenAPI spec
- [ ] **User Documentation**: User-facing changes documented (if applicable)
- [ ] **Deployment Notes**: Any special deployment requirements documented

### 5. Learning Platform Specific
- [ ] **Service Pattern Compliance**: New code follows modern service architecture (TASK-012)
- [ ] **Performance Verification**: Response times meet defined requirements
- [ ] **Data Integrity**: Student data, courses, and submissions protected
- [ ] **User Experience**: Validated with relevant user personas (student/instructor)

### 6. Release Readiness
- [ ] **Database Migrations**: Tested in staging environment (if applicable)
- [ ] **Configuration Changes**: Environment-specific settings documented
- [ ] **Feature Flags**: Implemented if feature needs gradual rollout

## DoD Validation Process

### Self-Validation
Developer completes initial DoD checklist before requesting review

### Peer Review
- Code review covers both functionality and DoD compliance
- Reviewer validates testing requirements and documentation

### Quality Assurance
- Manual testing of acceptance criteria
- Performance and security verification
- User experience validation
