#### 13 Points - Extra Large
- **Time:** 1-2 weeks (should be broken down)
- **Examples:**
  - Complete new feature workflow
  - Major architecture changes
  - Complex multi-service integration
- **Characteristics:** Epic-level work, should be broken into smaller tasks

### Estimation Guidelines

#### Planning Poker Process
1. **Task Review:** Present task with acceptance criteria
2. **Questions:** Team asks clarifying questions
3. **Individual Estimation:** Each developer estimates privately
4. **Reveal:** All estimates shown simultaneously
5. **Discussion:** Highest and lowest estimates explain reasoning
6. **Re-estimate:** Repeat until consensus or majority agreement

#### Estimation Factors
**Technical Complexity:**
- Algorithm complexity
- Integration points
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations

**Scope Uncertainty:**
- Requirement clarity
- Business rule complexity
- External dependencies
- Research required

**Implementation Risk:**
- New technology usage
- Architecture changes
- Third-party dependencies
- Data migration complexity

## Sprint Capacity Planning

### Capacity Calculation Formula
```
Sprint Capacity = (Team Size × Sprint Hours × Availability Factor × Velocity Factor)

Where:
- Team Size = Number of active developers
- Sprint Hours = 64 hours per developer (2-week sprint)
- Availability Factor = 0.8-1.0 (accounts for time off, meetings)
- Velocity Factor = 0.7-0.9 (accounts for interruptions, estimates variance)
```

### Example Calculation
**Team:** 3 developers (1 senior, 1 mid, 1 junior)
**Sprint:** 2 weeks

```
Senior Developer: 64 hours × 1.0 × 0.85 = 54 hours (≈27 story points)
Mid Developer: 64 hours × 0.8 × 0.85 = 43 hours (≈22 story points)
Junior Developer: 64 hours × 0.6 × 0.85 = 33 hours (≈16 story points)

Total Sprint Capacity: 65 story points
Safe Commitment: 52 story points (80% of capacity)
```

### Capacity Distribution Strategy

#### Priority-Based Allocation
- **P0 Tasks:** 40% of capacity (critical items)
- **P1 Tasks:** 40% of capacity (high priority)
- **P2 Tasks:** 15% of capacity (medium priority)
- **Buffer/P3:** 5% of capacity (unexpected issues)

#### Skill-Based Allocation
**Frontend-Heavy Sprint:**
- Frontend tasks: 60% of story points
- Backend tasks: 30% of story points
- Full-stack tasks: 10% of story points

**Backend-Heavy Sprint:**
- Backend tasks: 60% of story points
- Frontend tasks: 25% of story points
- Infrastructure: 15% of story points

## Velocity Tracking and Forecasting

### Velocity Metrics
