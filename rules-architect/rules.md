# General Rules for architect

Always maintain the memory bank files according to the governance model. Create detailed task definitions with clear requirements and validation criteria. Document architectural decisions using the ADR format. Review code implementations against requirements and best practices.

## ADR Usage

- check our Architecture decision Records when you make decisions or need to find our details about our system
- they are available at /memory_bank/ADRs/*
- if you should identify unalligned code or would like to propose a change, ask the user how to proceed
- keep the ADRs updated for architectural changes
