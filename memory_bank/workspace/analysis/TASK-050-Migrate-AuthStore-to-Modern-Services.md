# TASK-050: Migrate AuthStore to Modern Service Integration

**Priority**: High
**Type**: INFRASTRUCTURE - Store Migration
**Parent Task**: TASK-027-B (Modern Service State Integration)
**Dependencies**: TASK-027-B, TASK-049 (Task Store Migration)
**Created**: 2025-09-15

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Migrate the AuthStore to use modern service integration patterns, completing the critical store migrations in Phase 2 of the modern service strategy. This applies proven service-store integration patterns to authentication and authorization state management.

---

## BUSINESS CONTEXT

The AuthStore manages critical authentication state and user session data across the entire application. Migrating to modern service integration will:
- Improve security through better error handling and token management
- Provide consistent authentication state across all components
- Enable type-safe auth service interactions
- Establish patterns for authentication-related components

---

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### **Authentication Integration**
- [ ] Integrate modern authentication services with AuthStore
- [ ] Implement secure token management with service patterns
- [ ] Create typed hooks for authentication operations
- [ ] Establish session management with modern caching

### **Service Integration**
- [ ] Apply service integration patterns from TASK-027-B to auth flows
- [ ] Implement error handling for authentication failures
- [ ] Add loading states for login/logout operations
- [ ] Create secure storage patterns for tokens and user data

### **Security & Performance**
- [ ] Ensure secure token storage and refresh patterns
- [ ] Implement automatic session management
- [ ] Add authentication state caching with appropriate TTL
- [ ] Create secure error handling for auth failures

---

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

### **Security & Functionality**
- [ ] All authentication flows work with modern service patterns
- [ ] Secure token management and refresh cycles
- [ ] Improved error handling for authentication failures
- [ ] Session persistence across browser refreshes

### **Integration Success**
- [ ] Type-safe authentication hooks for all auth operations
- [ ] Consistent authentication state across components
- [ ] Better loading states during authentication
- [ ] Reduced authentication-related errors

### **Performance**
- [ ] Optimized authentication state management
- [ ] Reduced unnecessary authentication checks
- [ ] Improved session validation performance
- [ ] Better error recovery patterns

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### **Phase 1: Core Migration (3 hours)**
1. Apply service integration patterns to AuthStore
2. Migrate authentication service calls to modern patterns
3. Implement secure token management
4. Create typed authentication hooks

### **Phase 2: Security Enhancement (2 hours)**
1. Add automatic token refresh patterns
2. Implement secure error handling
3. Add session validation and recovery
4. Update authentication-related components

### **Phase 3: Testing & Validation (2 hours)**
1. Comprehensive security testing
2. Authentication flow validation
3. Error handling verification
4. Performance and reliability testing

---

## MIGRATION STRATEGY

### **Current State (Legacy)**
```typescript
// AuthStore with legacy patterns
const useAuthStore = create((set, get) => ({
  user: null,
  token: null,
  isLoading: false,

  login: async (credentials) => {
    set({ isLoading: true });
    try {
      const response = await authService.login(credentials);
      set({ user: response.user, token: response.token, isLoading: false });
    } catch (error) {
      set({ error, isLoading: false });
    }
  }
}));
```

### **Target State (Modern)**
```typescript
// AuthStore with modern service integration
const useAuthStore = create((set, get) => ({
  ...createAuthServiceIntegration(),

  // Enhanced with secure patterns and error handling
  login: createSecureOperation('auth', (credentials) =>
    modernAuthService.login(credentials)
  ),

  // Automatic token refresh
  refreshToken: createTokenRefreshOperation(),
}));

// Type-safe authentication hooks
const useAuth = () => createAuthHooks(useAuthStore);
```

---

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### **Token Management**
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Secure logout with token invalidation
- Protection against token leakage

### **Error Handling**
- Secure error messages (no sensitive information)
- Automatic retry for network failures
- Graceful degradation for auth failures
- User-friendly error recovery

### **Session Management**
- Persistent authentication across page refreshes
- Automatic logout on token expiration
- Session validation and recovery
- Cross-tab authentication synchronization

---

## DEPENDENCIES & BLOCKERS

### **DEPENDENCIES**
- **TASK-027-B**: Modern Service State Integration (COMPLETED)
- **TASK-049**: Task Store Migration (for patterns)

### **POTENTIAL BLOCKERS**
- Complex authentication flows requiring careful migration
- Security requirements for token management
- Cross-component authentication dependencies

---

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### **HIGH SECURITY FOCUS**
- Authentication is critical for application security
- Token management requires careful implementation
- Error handling must not expose sensitive information

### **MITIGATION STRATEGIES**
- Comprehensive security testing at each step
- Use proven patterns from TASK-027-B
- Thorough authentication flow validation
- Security review before deployment

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### **BEFORE (Current State)**
- Basic authentication state management
- Standard token storage patterns
- Basic error handling for auth failures

### **AFTER (Target State)**
- Modern service integration with secure patterns
- Enhanced token management and refresh
- Improved error handling and user experience
